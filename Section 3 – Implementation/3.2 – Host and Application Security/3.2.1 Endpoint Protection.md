# Endpoint Security: Layered Protection Defense in Depth

## Antivirus and Anti-Malware

- **Purpose:**
    - Protection against viruses, worms, trojans, and malware.
    - Combines antivirus and anti-malware capabilities.

- **Challenges:**
    - Reliance on signature-based detection.
    - Evolving threats require additional methods.

## Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

- **Functionality:**
    - Identifying malicious behavior.
    - Utilizes machine learning and process monitoring.
    - Automated response, isolation, quarantine, or restoration.

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- **Objective:**
    - Preventing sensitive data leakage.
    - Implemented in firewalls, client software, or cloud solutions.
    - Blocks transfer of sensitive data outside the private network.

## Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)

- **Capabilities:**
    - Identifying applications, regardless of IP or port.
    - Granular control over application features.
    - SSL decryption, antivirus, anti-malware, URL filtering.

## Host-Based Firewalls

- **Significance:**
    - Software on individual endpoints.
    - Monitors and controls communication for each application.
    - Manages encrypted traffic on the endpoint itself.

## Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) / Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)

- **Functionality:**
    - HIDS examines log files for intrusion identification.
    - HIPS proactively blocks known vulnerabilities.
    - Uses signatures, heuristics, behavioral analysis.

- **Detection Techniques:**
    - Signature-based identification.
    - Heuristics for anomalies.
    - Behavioral analysis for unusual activities.

- **Endpoint Access:**
    - Full access to data on the system, even in-memory information.
