# Application Security and Testing

## Introduction

- **Security in Application Development:**
    - Critical for protecting against vulnerabilities and attacks.
    - Developers balance functionality and security.

- **Quality Assurance (QA) Testing:**
    - Ensures application works to specification.
    - QA team checks for security vulnerabilities.
    - Vulnerabilities may go unnoticed despite testing.

## Input Validation and Normalization

- **Input Validation:**
    - Key for preventing vulnerabilities.
    - Developers must understand input sources.
    - Normalization ensures data consistency.

- **Normalization Example:**
    - Zip code format standardization.
    - Data outside defined rules is corrected or rejected.

## Fuzzing and Dynamic Analysis

- **Fuzzing (Dynamic Analysis):**
    - Random data input into applications.
    - Aims to discover unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    - Continuous automated testing with tools like fuzzers.

- **Fuzzing Framework Example:**
    - CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF).
    - Automates fuzzing tests.
    - Detects vulnerabilities by randomizing inputs.

## Cookie Security

- **Cookies:**
    - Store information locally from browsers.
    - Commonly used for tracking and session management.
    - Secure cookies require HTTPS for transmission.

- **HTTP Secure Headers:**
    - Configure web servers to restrict browser capabilities.
    - Control communication protocols and loading of resources.

## Code Signing

- **Code Signing:**
    - Uses digital signatures to confirm code authenticity.
    - Developer signs code with private key.
    - Public key validation ensures code integrity.

## Application Allow and Deny Lists

- **Allow and Deny Lists:**
    - Admins configure operating systems or security software.
    - Criteria for lists can include application hashes, digital signatures, folders, network zones, etc.

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

- **SAST (Static Code Analysis):**
    - Automated analysis of source code.
    - Identifies vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
    - May not catch all types of vulnerabilities.

- **Example Output from SAST:**
    - Identifies potential issues in source code.
    - Requires manual examination and confirmation.
    - Ensures vulnerabilities are resolved before deployment.
