# Database Security: Tokenization and Hashing

## Tokenization

- **Protecting Sensitive Data:**
    - Valuable data stored in databases.
    - Compliance with rules (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).

- **Tokenization Technique:**
    - Replaces sensitive data with tokens.
    - Example: Social security number replaced by a token.
    - Tokens limit usability and protect against unauthorized access.
    
- **Credit Card Tokenization:**
    - Temporary token used for purchases.
    - Token validated during the purchase process.
    - Tokens discarded after use, enhancing security.

- **Advantages:**
    - No need for hashing or encryption.
    - Overhead-free cryptographic functions.
    - Limiting token use adds an extra layer of protection.

## Hashing

- **Storing Information as Hash:**
    - Common with passwords.
    - Password stored as a message digest (hash).

- **Hash Characteristics:**
    - Unique hash for different inputs.
    - No duplicated hash values (collision).
    - Irreversible process (one-way trip).
    - No retrieval of original data from hash.

- **Example: SHA-256 Hashes:**
    - Original password: 123456.
    - Hash: A long 256-bit value.
    - Different inputs yield vastly different hashes.

- **Salt for Randomization:**
    - Additional information during hashing.
    - User-specific salt adds randomization.
    - Prevents rainbow table attacks.

- **Salt Example:**
    - Users with the same password (e.g., "dragon").
    - Different salt for each user results in unique hash.
    - Attackers face challenges in brute-forcing original passwords.

- **Advantages:**
    - Increased security with randomization.
    - Defends against rainbow table attacks.
    - Slows down attackers attempting brute force.
