# Application Hardening Techniques

## Introduction

- **Application Hardening:**
    - Minimizes attack surfaces and limits exploitability.
    - Protects against both known and unknown attack points.

- **Compliance and Third-Party Guidance:**
    - HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other regulations provide guidance.
    - Resources from CIS, SANS, NIST assist in hardening.

## Port and Service Hardening

- **Port Limitation:**
    - Close unnecessary ports.
    - Use firewalls to restrict IP addresses and applications.

- **Application Testing:**
    - Regularly test ports using tools like Nmap.
    - Only open ports necessary for application functionality.

## Windows Registry Hardening

- **Windows Registry:**
    - Configuration settings database for Windows.
    - Changes made by applications may affect security.
    - Use third-party tools to monitor registry changes.

## Data Encryption

- **Full Disk Encryption (FDE):**
    - Encrypts entire storage drive.
    - BitLocker on Windows, Opal standard for self-encrypting drives.

## Operating System Hardening

- **Keeping OS Updated:**
    - Regularly apply updates and patches.
    - Monthly updates for OS and manufacturer fixes.

- **User Account Hardening:**
    - Enforce strong password policies.
    - Limit user account permissions.
    - Control access to network resources.

## Antivirus and Security Software

- **Endpoint Protection:**
    - Run antivirus and anti-malware software.
    - Protects against OS-level attacks.

## Patch Management

- **Patch Deployment:**
    - Automated systems for OS and application updates.
    - Test updates before deployment in enterprise environments.

- **Emergency Updates:**
    - Rapid deployment for zero-day vulnerabilities.

## Sandboxing

- **Sandbox Functionality:**
    - Limits applications to their designated scope.
    - Common in development and production environments.
    - Virtual machines, mobile browsers, and Windows UAC use sandboxing.
