# Mobile Device Management and Security

## Introduction

In modern organizations, the prevalence of mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones, necessitates effective management to ensure security, especially when employees bring their own devices into the workplace. Mobile Device Management (MDM) plays a crucial role in tracking devices, managing applications, enforcing security policies, and safeguarding sensitive corporate information.

## Managing Applications with MDM

- **Application Policies:**
	- Set policies based on applications, data types, and device functionalities.
	- Control application versions and upgrades in corporate environments.

- **Allow Lists:**
	- Manage application installations using allow lists.
	- Administer a list of trusted applications to prevent malicious software installations.

## Mobile Content Management (MCM) for Data Security

- **Data Storage Policies:**
	- Secure data on mobile devices through Mobile Content Management.
	- Implement policies based on data storage locations, including on-site and cloud-based storage.

- **Data Loss Prevention:**
	- Use MCM for data loss prevention, especially for sensitive information.
	- Restrict the transmission of sensitive data outside the mobile device.

- **Encryption Measures:**
	- Ensure all stored data is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
	- Configure encryption settings through the Mobile Device Manager.

## Remote Wipe and Data Backup

- **Remote Wipe Functionality:**
	- Implement remote wipe capabilities through the Mobile Device Manager.
	- Erase all data on a lost or stolen device even without physical access.

- **Data Backup Best Practices:**
	- Emphasize the importance of regular data backups.
	- Facilitate quick restoration of data on replacement devices.

## Geolocation and Geofencing

- **Precision of Geolocation:**
	- Utilize GPS and wireless networks for accurate device location.
	- Consider privacy concerns associated with geolocation features.

- **Geofencing Application:**
	- Implement geofencing using Mobile Device Manager.
	- Enable or disable device features based on the device's physical location.

## Screen Locks and Authentication

- **Importance of Screen Locks:**
	- Enforce screen locks on mobile devices, especially for corporate data.
	- Configure screen lock settings through the Mobile Device Manager.

- **Multifactor Authentication:**
	- Implement multifactor authentication on mobile devices.
	- Utilize biometric authentication for enhanced security.

- **Context-Aware Authentication:**
	- Explore context-aware authentication for additional criteria.
	- Combine characteristics such as IP address, location, and device context during authentication.

## Containerization for Data Separation

- **Containerization Concept:**
	- Implement containerization to separate corporate and personal data.
	- Ease the offboarding process by removing corporate data while preserving personal information.

## Full Device Encryption (FDE) and Key Management

- **FDE Implementation:**
	- Deploy full device encryption to secure all data on the mobile device.
	- Balance encryption strength with device performance and battery life.

- **Decryption Key Backup:**
	- Ensure backup of decryption keys on the Mobile Device Manager.
	- Facilitate data recovery on different hardware or with new credentials.

## Conclusion

Mobile Device Management is a critical component of maintaining a secure mobile environment. By effectively managing applications, securing data, implementing remote wipe capabilities, and utilizing advanced authentication methods, organizations can mitigate risks associated with the use of mobile devices in the workplace.
