# Mobile Deployment Models

## Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

- **Overview:**
    - Employees bring personal smartphones or tablets to the workplace for both personal and corporate use.
  
- **Security Challenges:**
    - Single device storing personal and corporate data requires robust security measures.
    - Differentiation between personal and corporate data is crucial.

- **Device Disposal Considerations:**
    - Security administrators manage device disposal through Mobile Device Manager (MDM).

## Corporate Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)

- **Overview:**
    - Company purchases smartphones or tablets for employees' use, serving both personal and corporate purposes.
  
- **Administrative Control:**
    - Full control by the organization, similar to company-assigned laptops or desktops.
    - MDM administers device, determining stored information and deletable data.

## Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)

- **Overview:**
    - Employees select their preferred device, and the organization purchases the chosen device for them.
  
- **User Device Choice:**
    - Users have the freedom to choose the device they want to use for work.
  
## Corporate Owned, Personal Device (Separate Devices)

- **Overview:**
    - The organization owns the device strictly for corporate use.
    - Employees must use a separate personal device for personal use.
  
- **Data Privacy:**
    - Ensures data privacy by keeping personal and corporate data on separate devices.
  
- **Commonality:**
    - May not be the most common deployment but suitable for organizations prioritizing data privacy.

## Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Virtual Mobile Infrastructure (VMI)

- **Overview:**
    - Separates applications and data from the mobile device, storing them externally.
  
- **Data Security:**
    - Enhances security by keeping data and applications external to the mobile device.
  
- **Data Loss Mitigation:**
    - If the mobile device is lost, data remains secure and can be easily accessed from a replacement device.
  
- **Ease of Application Management:**
    - Simplifies application management; updates are done on the VDI or VMI management server.
    - Ideal for app developers building applications on a single platform (VDI or VMI).

## Conclusion

Mobile deployment models vary, each with its advantages and considerations. Organizations must choose the model that aligns with their security needs, data privacy concerns, and overall operational requirements.
