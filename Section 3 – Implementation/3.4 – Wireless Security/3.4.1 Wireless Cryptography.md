# Wireless Network Security

In wired networks, eavesdropping is less of a concern, but on wireless networks, anyone nearby can intercept and listen to the traffic. Consequently, additional security controls are crucial for wireless networks. Authentication is a key component, and it can take various forms such as usernames, passwords, multifactor authentication, 802.1X, smart cards, or other methods.

## Authentication and Encryption

- **Authentication:**
    - Various methods, including usernames, passwords, multifactor, 802.1X, and smart cards.
  
- **Encryption:**
    - Essential for securing wireless traffic.
    - Prevents unauthorized access to data intercepted from the air.

- **Integrity Check:**
    - Ensures received information matches the original data.
    - Message Integrity Check (MIC) or similar methods verify data integrity.

## WPA2 and WPA3 Encryption

### WPA2

- **Introduction:**
    - Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) since 2004.
    - Uses CCMP block cipher mode for encryption.
  
- **Security Protocol Components:**
    - AES for data confidentiality.
    - CBC-MAC for Message Integrity Check (MIC).

### WPA3

- **Introduction:**
    - Introduced in 2018 as an update to WPA2.
    - Uses GCMP block cipher mode for stronger encryption.
  
- **Encryption and Integrity:**
    - Confidentiality uses AES.
    - Message Integrity Check (MIC) uses Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC).

- **Security Enhancements:**
    - Addresses challenges in WPA2 security.
    - Changes in key exchange and mutual authentication.

## Brute Force Attacks and WPA3

- **WPA2 Pre-shared Key Issue:**
    - Vulnerable to brute force attacks.
    - Hash obtained during four-way handshake.

- **Advancements in WPA3:**
    - Changed authentication process.
    - Added mutual authentication.
    - Key exchange without sending hashes over the network.
    - Perfect forward secrecy for session keys.

- **Session Key Creation:**
    - Uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE).
    - Derived from Diffie-Hellman with additional authentication components.
  
- **Security Benefits of WPA3:**
    - Eliminates hash-related brute force attacks.
    - Perfect forward secrecy enhances key security.
    - Dragonfly handshake is part of the IEEE 802.11 standard.

In conclusion, wireless network security requires robust authentication and encryption measures. WPA2 and WPA3 play pivotal roles in securing wireless communication, with WPA3 addressing vulnerabilities associated with hash-related brute force attacks through advancements in authentication and key exchange processes.
