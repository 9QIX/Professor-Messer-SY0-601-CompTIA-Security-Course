# Wireless Network Authentication and Security

## Overview

- **Authentication Importance:**
    - Crucial step when connecting to a wireless network.
    - Ensures authorized access and prevents unauthorized usage.
    - Different authentication methods cater to diverse network environments.

## Authentication Methods

- **Pre-Shared Key (PSK):**
    - Shared password for all users.
    - Commonly used in home networks.
    - Lacks individual user authentication.

- **802.1X (Enterprise):**
    - Centralized authentication for corporate environments.
    - Utilizes credentials from Windows Active Directory domain.
    - Ensures unique access, facilitating individual user management.

- **WPA3-Personal (PSK):**
    - Enhanced security compared to WPA2.
    - Employs Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) for individual session keys.
    - Each user, despite a shared key, has a distinct session key for heightened security.

- **WPA3-Enterprise (802.1X):**
    - Designed for office environments.
    - Leverages centralized authentication servers (RADIUS, TACACS, LDAP).
    - Enables efficient management of usernames and passwords.

## Captive Portal Authentication

- **Usage in Temporary Networks:**
    - Common in coffee shops, hotels, and temporary setups.
    - Redirects users to a login page before granting network access.
    - Supports various authentication factors (username, password, etc.).

- **Session Management:**
    - Timeout functionality for session expiration.
    - Users reconnect by re-entering credentials through the captive portal.
    - Ensures temporary users reauthenticate for continued access.

## Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) Authentication

- **Simplified Authentication:**
    - Introduced for user and administrator convenience.
    - Methods include Personal Identification Number (PIN), button push, or NFC.
    - Aims to eliminate complex configuration processes.

- **Security Concerns:**
    - PIN vulnerability due to limited combinations.
    - Built with flaws that compromise security.
    - Best practice often involves disabling WPS on wireless access points.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the authentication process in wireless networks is diverse, catering to different environments and security needs. While methods like WPA3 enhance security through individualized session keys, others like WPS, despite simplifying the process, may introduce vulnerabilities. Choosing the right authentication method depends on the specific requirements and security considerations of the network environment.
