# Wireless Network Authentication Methods with EAP

## Introduction

In a previous discussion, we explored the imperative need for authenticating to wireless networks due to the diverse nature of network environments. Various authentication methods have been employed over the years, with a focus on ensuring secure and authorized access.

## Common Authentication Method: Username and Password

- **Usage Across Networks:**
    - Widely used for both wired and wireless networks.
    - Often accompanied by additional authentication factors.
    - Essential for preventing unauthorized access.

- **Application in Wireless Networks:**
    - Particularly crucial for wireless networks due to the broadcast nature of wireless communication.
    - Protects against unauthorized connection attempts from nearby wireless devices.

## Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Framework

- **Standard Framework:**
    - Basis for many wireless network authentication methods.
    - Diverse range of EAP methods tailored by different manufacturers.

## 802.1X Authentication in Enterprise Environments

- **Port-Based Network Access Control (NAC):**
    - Essential for wired and wireless networks.
    - No access granted without proper 802.1X credentials.
    - Relies on centralized authentication databases.

- **Centralized Databases:**
    - Commonly employs RADIUS, TACACS, or LDAP for centralized user authentication.
    - Three key components: supplicant, authenticator, and centralized authentication server.

## EAP-FAST for Secure Authentication

- **Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling:**
    - EAP-FAST ensures secure information exchange between supplicant and authentication server.
    - Utilizes a Protected Access Credential (PAC) and sets up a Transport Layer Security Tunnel.

- **Common Implementation:**
    - Often deployed with RADIUS servers, combining authentication database and EAP-FAST services.

## PEAP for Enhanced Security

- **Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol:**
    - Developed by Cisco, Microsoft, and RSA Security.
    - Utilizes TLS with a digital certificate for secure information transmission.

- **Integration with MS-CHAPv2:**
    - Commonly combined with Microsoft's Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2.

## EAP-TLS for Mutual Authentication

- **Transport Layer Security:**
    - Provides strong encryption for data exchange.
    - Requires digital certificates on all devices for mutual authentication.

- **Challenges and Considerations:**
    - Management complexities in handling individual digital certificates.
    - Incompatibility with older devices lacking support for digital certificates.

## EAP-TTLS for Versatile Authentication

- **Tunneled Transport Layer Security:**
    - Allows tunneling of various authentication protocols within the TLS tunnel.
    - Requires a single digital certificate on the authentication server.

- **Simplified Deployment:**
    - Eliminates the need for separate digital certificates on individual devices.

## EAP in Federation and RADIUS Federation with eduroam

- **Federation Concept:**
    - Links a user's identity across multiple authentication systems.
    - Commonly used in third-party locations for cross-system authentication.

- **RADIUS Federation with eduroam:**
    - Utilizes 802.1X as the authentication method.
    - Facilitates educators' authentication across different campuses with a single set of credentials.

In summary, wireless network authentication methods leverage EAP in various ways, with considerations for security, deployment simplicity, and compatibility with diverse network environments. The choice of authentication method depends on the specific requirements and infrastructure of the network.
