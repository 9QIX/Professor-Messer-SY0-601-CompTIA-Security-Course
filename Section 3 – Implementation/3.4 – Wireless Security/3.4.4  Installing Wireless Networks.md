# Wireless Network Installation and Site Survey

## Introduction

Before installing a wireless network, understanding the environment is crucial. Performing a site survey provides valuable insights into the existing wireless infrastructure, enabling effective planning and deployment.

## Site Survey Considerations

- **Existing Access Points:**
	- Identify and assess current access points in the installation vicinity.
	- Determine potential interference and overlapping frequencies.

- **Dynamic Environment:**
	- Recognize that wireless landscapes change over time.
	- Periodic site surveys ensure ongoing optimal performance.

## Heat Maps for Visualization

- **Tool Utilization:**
	- Use heat map tools to visually represent wireless networks.
	- Move around the area to capture signal strengths and network layouts.

- **Software Tools:**
	- Run wireless survey tools on laptops or mobile devices.
	- Obtain information on wireless signals, frequencies, and potential interference.

- **Hardware-Based Solutions:**
	- Explore spectrum analysis tools for in-depth information on frequency usage.
	- Understand spectrum characteristics for informed decision-making.

## Wireless Packet Analysis

- **Capture Wireless Data:**
	- Use wireless packet analyzers to capture signals and analyze data.
	- Understand signal-to-noise ratio, channel details, and overall network utilization.

- **Wireshark Example:**
	- Download Wireshark from [www.wireshark.org](www.wireshark.org).
	- Install it on a machine with a wireless adapter card for local network analysis.

## Frequency Considerations

- **Avoiding Interference:**
	- Prevent interference by ensuring neighboring access points use different frequencies.
	- Channels 1, 6, and 11 in the 2.4 GHz range offer non-overlapping options.

- **5 GHz Flexibility:**
	- Utilize the broader range of channels available in the 5 GHz spectrum.
	- Plan access points to minimize interference and maximize efficiency.

- **Channel Separation:**
	- Configure access points with channel separation to avoid conflicts.
	- Perform site surveys to choose optimal channels during installation.

## Access Point Placement

- **Optimal Locations:**
	- Install access points with minimal overlap and maximal coverage.
	- Avoid placing access points directly next to each other for efficient usage.

- **Interference Avoidance:**
	- Ensure locations are free from electronic devices causing interference.
	- Avoid signal absorption areas within the building.

- **User Proximity:**
	- Place access points close to user work areas for optimal signal strength.
	- Avoid excessive signal range that extends beyond required workspaces.

## Building Layout Example

- **Strategic Overlapping:**
	- Strategically overlap access points for comprehensive coverage.
	- Assign different channels to avoid interference between adjacent access points.

- **Channel Configuration:**
	- Separate channels to minimize interference and optimize network efficiency.

## Wireless Controller Management

- **Centralized Management:**
	- Utilize a wireless controller for centralized access point management.
	- Update configurations, firmware, and ensure security measures.

- **Browser Configuration:**
	- Connect to the wireless controller securely using HTTPS.
	- Enable encrypted communication between the browser and the controller.

- **Timeout Measures:**
	- Implement automatic log-out during periods of inactivity for security.

## Access Point Security

- **Strong Authentication:**
	- Enforce strong passwords or robust authentication methods on access points.
	- Regularly update access point software to maintain security.

In summary, a comprehensive site survey and strategic planning are essential for successful wireless network installation. Considerations for frequencies, access point placement, and centralized management contribute to efficient and secure network operations.
