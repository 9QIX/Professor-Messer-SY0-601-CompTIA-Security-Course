# Cryptographic Protocols and Security Measures

## Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and Secure RTP (SRTP)

- **Usage:**
    - RTP for voice and video over IP.
    - SRTP for encrypted communication.

- **Security Features (SRTP):**
    - AES encryption.
    - HMAC-SHA1 for authentication.
    - Integrity and replay protection.

## Network Time Protocol (NTP) Security

- **Vulnerability:**
    - Legacy NTP lacked security features.
    - Vulnerable to amplification attacks.

- **Solution:**
    - NTPsec (Secure NTP) with added security features.

## Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)

- **Purpose:**
    - Encrypting and signing email messages.

- **Key Requirement:**
    - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for key management.

## Email Security Protocols

- **POP3 and IMAP Security:**
    - POP3 with STARTTLS for SSL.
    - IMAP with Secure IMAP using SSL.

- **Web-Based Email:**
    - Always use SSL (HTTPS).

## Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)

- **Functionality:**
    - Secure communication over the public internet.
    - Encryption, packet signing, and anti-replay features.

- **Protocols:**
    - Authentication Header (AH) for integrity.
    - Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) for encryption.

## Secure File Transfer Protocols

- **FTPS and SFTP:**
    - FTPS uses SSL for encryption.
    - SFTP uses SSH for encryption and additional management features.

## Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Security

- **LDAP and LDAPS:**
    - LDAP for centralized directory access.
    - LDAPS for LDAP over SSL for enhanced security.

- **Authentication:**
    - Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) for additional security.

## Secure Shell (SSH)

- **SSH Usage:**
    - Terminal communication with encryption.
    - Replaced insecure telnet.

## Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)

- **Security Enhancement:**
    - DNSSEC for secure DNS communication.
    - Public key cryptography for data validation.

## Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3)

- **SNMP Security:**
    - SNMPv3 for confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
    - Encryption for secure communication.

## Web-Based Management

- **Secure Web Browsing:**
    - Use HTTPS (HTTP over TLS/SSL) for confidentiality.
    - HTTPS is standard for securing web communication.

## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Security

- **Security Measures:**
    - Authorizing DHCP servers (e.g., in Active Directory).
    - DHCP snooping on switches.
    - Limiting MAC addresses to prevent DHCP starvation attacks.

## Automated Updates Security

- **Device Updates:**
    - Various devices with different update methods.
    - Configure firewalls for trusted update servers.
