# Access Control and Posture Assessment

## Introduction

- **Firewall Rules vs. Access Control:**
    - Firewalls primarily manage traffic at the network edge.
    - Access control involves more granular rules based on users, groups, location, and applications.
    - Access control rules are dynamic and can change frequently.

- **BYOD Challenges:**
    - BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments present security challenges.
    - Concerns include malware, lack of anti-malware software, and unwanted applications.
    - The need to protect the network while allowing external devices to connect.

## Posture Assessment

- **Purpose:**
    - Check the status of devices connecting to the network.
    - Ensure compliance with security policies.
    - Assess factors like antivirus, software versions, and encryption status.

- **Key Criteria:**
    - Device configuration and trust.
    - Antivirus presence, type, and version.
    - Corporate applications installed.
    - Encryption status, especially for mobile devices.

- **Operating Systems and Posture Assessment:**
    - Posture assessment is not OS-specific.
    - Applies to Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, etc.
    - Necessitates running software on devices for assessment.

## Agents for Posture Assessment

- **Persistent Agents:**
    - Installed permanently on devices.
    - Requires ongoing management, updates, and maintenance.
    - Ensures continuous assessment.

- **Dissolvable Agents:**
    - Temporary software for assessment.
    - Runs during connection, terminates afterward.
    - Reduces management overhead.

- **Agentless NAC:**
    - Integrated with the operating system.
    - Example: Windows with Active Directory.
    - Performs checks during log in/out but lacks scheduling flexibility.

## Network Access Control (NAC) Process

1. **Configuration:**
    - Security team configures NAC with minimum requirements.

2. **User Connection:**
    - NAC evaluates user's connection during login.

3. **Health Check:**
    - Device assessed for compliance with posture requirements.

4. **Quarantine for Non-Compliant Devices:**
    - Devices failing health check placed in a quarantine network.
    - Users notified of non-compliance.

5. **Resolution by Users:**
    - Users address identified issues (e.g., install required software).

6. **Reconnection Attempt:**
    - Users attempt to reconnect.

7. **Repeat Health Check:**
    - NAC performs a new posture assessment.
    - If issues persist, the process repeats.

8. **Network Access Granted:**
    - Upon meeting requirements, user gains access to the network.

## Conclusion

- **Dynamic Access Control:**
    - Access control rules change based on user, device, and requirements.
    - Essential for securing networks in BYOD environments.
    - Posture assessment ensures ongoing compliance.
