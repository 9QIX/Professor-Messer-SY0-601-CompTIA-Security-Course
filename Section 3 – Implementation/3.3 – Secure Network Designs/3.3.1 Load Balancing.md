# Load Balancing Technology

## Overview

- **Load Balancing:**
    - Distributes incoming load across multiple devices.
    - Implemented with multiple servers behind the scenes.
    - Enhances resource availability and scalability.

## Load Balancer Functions

- **Automatic Distribution:**
    - Distributes queries to available servers without end-user knowledge.
    - Scales up for large implementations.
    - Continues operations if a server fails.

- **Load Balancer Configurations:**
    - Balances TCP overhead across servers.
    - Handles SSL offloading for encryption/decryption.
    - Provides caching services for common responses.

- **Additional Functions:**
    - Quality of service (QoS) prioritization.
    - Content switching for application distribution.

## Load Balancer Operation Modes

- **Round-Robin Configuration:**
    - Users distributed to servers in sequential order.
    - Variants include weighted round-robin and dynamic round-robin.

- **Active/Active Load Balancing:**
    - All servers active simultaneously.
    - Continues operation if one server fails.

- **Affinity in Load Balancing:**
    - Ensures a user communicates with the same server.
    - Tracked using session ID or variables (IP address, port numbers).

- **Active/Passive Load Balancing:**
    - Some servers active, others on standby.
    - Standby servers become active if an active server fails.
