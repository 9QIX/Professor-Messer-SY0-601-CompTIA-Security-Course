# Port Security and Network Control Mechanisms

## Introduction to Port Security

- **Port Security Definition:**
	- Refers to securing physical interfaces on switches or routers.
	- Not related to TCP or UDP ports; focuses on physical connections.

- **Objective:**
	- Maintain network uptime and availability.
	- Control and limit overall network traffic.
	- Manage and filter broadcast traffic.
	- Implement security measures at the port level.

## Broadcast Traffic Management

- **Broadcasts in IPv4 Networks:**
	- Commonly used for protocols like routing updates and ARP requests.
	- Managed through functionality in managed switches.
	- Limiting broadcasts helps prevent unnecessary bandwidth usage.

- **IPv6 and Multicast:**
	- IPv6 focuses on multicast rather than broadcasts.
	- Easier to manage multicast traffic compared to broadcasts.

- **Switch Functionality:**
	- Managed switches can control and limit broadcasts.
	- Set thresholds for the number of broadcasts per second.
	- Monitor and remove broadcasts if they increase rapidly.

## Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

- **Preventing Loops:**
	- IEEE standard 802.1D: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
	- Designed to prevent loops on layer 2 networks.
	- Ensures network stability and prevents broadcast storms.

- **STP Operation:**
	- Identifies and blocks redundant paths to prevent loops.
	- Constantly monitors the network for topology changes.
	- Enables network convergence in case of outages.

- **PortFast and BPDU Guard:**
	- **PortFast:** Allows instant communication for end stations.
	- **BPDU Guard:** Disables PortFast if a switch is detected on the interface.

## DHCP Snooping

- **DHCP Snooping Overview:**
	- Prevents unauthorized DHCP servers on the network.
	- Switch identifies trusted and untrusted interfaces.
	- Filters DHCP traffic on untrusted interfaces.

## MAC Filtering

- **MAC Filtering Definition:**
	- Controls traffic based on Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.
	- Allows or disallows traffic based on MAC addresses.

- **Limitations and Challenges:**
	- No encryption for MAC addresses.
	- Vulnerable to MAC address spoofing.
	- More of an administrative tool than a robust security measure.

## Conclusion

- Port security involves managing physical interfaces on switches.
- Techniques like broadcast traffic control, Spanning Tree Protocol, DHCP snooping, and MAC filtering enhance network security.
- Each mechanism addresses specific aspects of network control and security.
- A combination of these measures provides a comprehensive approach to port security.
