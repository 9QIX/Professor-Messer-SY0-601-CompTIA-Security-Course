# DNS Security, Quality of Service, IPv6 Security, and Network Monitoring

## DNS Security

- **DNS Insecurity:**
    - Originally built without security features.
    - DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) introduced for security.
    - Provides origin authentication and data integrity using public key cryptography.

- **DNS as a Security Tool:**
    - DNS servers used for security by redirecting users from malicious sites.
    - Sinkhole address redirects users to a predefined location.
    - Enables logging and reporting for identifying malware-infected stations.
    - Acts as content filtering by blocking unwanted or suspicious sites.

## Out-of-Band Management

- **Managing Remote Devices:**
    - Out-of-band management used for remote troubleshooting.
    - Separate interfaces on devices for management purposes.
    - Wired or wireless modems connected to serial or additional Ethernet ports.
    - Centralized console routers or comm servers for managing multiple devices.

## Quality of Service (QoS)

- **Application Prioritization:**
    - Different devices and applications have varying requirements.
    - Real-time applications (VoIP) may need higher priority than others.
    - QoS prioritizes applications based on response times, bandwidth, and traffic rates.
    - Ensures optimal performance for critical applications.

- **Implementation of QoS:**
    - Implemented in switches, routers, firewalls, or other network devices.
    - Prioritization configuration varies based on equipment and application needs.

## IPv6 Security

- **IPv6 Security Features:**
    - Built with security in mind compared to IPv4.
    - Larger address space makes complete port or interface scans challenging.
    - IPv6 security tools updated to address new requirements.
    - Removal of ARP reduces ARP spoofing risks.

- **Security Considerations:**
    - Neighbor Cache Exhaustion remains a potential IPv6 security risk.
    - IPv6 introduces changes to security mechanisms compared to IPv4.

## Taps, Port Mirrors, and Monitoring

- **Network Monitoring Tools:**
    - Taps and port mirrors used for network monitoring.
    - Physical taps intercept network traffic for analysis.
    - Port mirrors (SPAN or switched port analyzer) provide software-based tapping.

- **Security Concerns:**
    - Unauthorized taps pose security risks.
    - Port mirrors assist in troubleshooting and analysis when physical taps are not viable.

## Security Operations Center (SOC) and Monitoring Services

- **SOC Overview:**
    - Monitoring services provide continuous security monitoring.
    - Security Operations Center (SOC) staffed by experts.
    - Constant monitoring of network traffic for threat detection.
    - Quick reaction to security incidents and ongoing compliance checks.

## File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
    - Monitors system files for unauthorized changes.
    - Detects modifications to critical files, indicating potential security threats.
    - Examples include SFC utility in Windows and tripwire in Linux.
    - Host-based IPS solutions often include file integrity monitoring.
