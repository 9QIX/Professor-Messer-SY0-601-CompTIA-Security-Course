# Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and Encryption Protocols

## VPN Overview

- **Definition:**
	- VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts data for secure transmission over a public network.
	- Commonly used on the internet to secure communications between two points.

- **VPN Concentrator:**
	- Central device responsible for encrypting and decrypting data in a VPN.
	- Can be a standalone device or integrated into other devices like firewalls.

- **VPN Implementations:**
	- Hardware devices, purpose-built appliances, or software.
	- End stations use a client to encrypt and decrypt data.

## Remote User VPN (SSL VPN)

- **User Scenario:**
	- Users at home, coffee shops, hotels need secure access to corporate networks.

- **SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer VPN):**
	- Commonly used for individual users.
	- Communicates over TCP port 443 for widespread compatibility.
	- Often uses a small client or runs directly in modern browsers supporting HTML5.

- **Authentication:**
	- Typically username, password, and two-factor authentication.
	- Simplified compared to complex authentication methods like IPSec.

- **VPN Tunnel Configuration:**
	- **Full Tunnel:** All data sent to the VPN concentrator for decision-making.
	- **Split Tunnel:** Allows some data to bypass the tunnel and go directly to its destination.

## Site-to-Site VPN

- **Corporate Network Scenario:**
	- Connects remote sites securely over the internet.

- **Protocols Used:**
	- **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol):**
		- Connects networks as if on the same Layer 2 network.
	- **IPSec (Internet Protocol Security):**
		- Provides authentication and encryption over Layer 3 networks.
		- Often used in conjunction with L2TP (L2TP/IPSec).

- **Data Flow Protection:**
	- **Transport Mode:** Encrypts data only, leaving the IP header visible.
	- **Tunnel Mode:** Encrypts both IP header and data for enhanced security.

- **IPSec Protocols:**
	- **AH (Authentication Header):**
		- Provides data integrity through hashing.
		- Shared key authentication.
	- **ESP (Encapsulation Security Payload):**
		- Encrypts and authenticates data.
		- Commonly uses SHA-2 for hashing and AES for encryption.

- **Authentication Header and Encapsulation Security Payload:**
	- Illustrated graphic combining both headers in transport and tunnel modes.

## Conclusion

- VPNs play a crucial role in securing data transmission over public networks.
- SSL VPNs are user-friendly and suitable for remote access.
- Site-to-site VPNs use protocols like L2TP and IPSec to securely connect corporate networks.
- IPSec provides both authentication and encryption, with options for transport and tunnel modes.
