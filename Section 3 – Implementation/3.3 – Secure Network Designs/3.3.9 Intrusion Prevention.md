# Network-Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) play a crucial role in securing networks by identifying and mitigating known attacks. These attacks often target specific operating systems or application servers, exploiting vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, database injections, cross-site scripting, and others.

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

- **Function:**
    - Identifies attacks.
    - Alarms or alerts when a problem occurs.
    - Lacks real-time blocking capabilities.

- **Common Focus Areas:**
    - Individual operating systems.
    - Application servers.

- **Alerting:**
    - Alerts system administrators when a problem is detected.

## Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

- **Function:**
    - Blocks or mitigates attacks in real-time.
    - Valuable for ensuring malicious traffic doesn't enter the network.

- **Configuration:**
    - May be referred to as IDS if not configured for real-time blocking.

## Connecting IDS/IPS to the Network

- **Passive Monitoring:**
    - IDS/IPS connected through a passive monitoring system.
    - Traffic redirected from devices on the network to the IDS/IPS.
    - No real-time blocking; alerts generated for administrators.

- **Out-of-Band Response:**
    - IDS/IPS in passive mode.
    - Limits subsequent traffic flow after identifying malicious traffic.
    - Uses out-of-band response methods, like sending TCP reset frames.

- **In-Band Deployment:**
    - IDS/IPS in line with actual traffic flows.
    - Evaluates all traffic in real-time.
    - Blocks malicious traffic immediately.

## IPS Response Methods

- **Out-of-Band:**
    - Limits subsequent traffic without stopping the original packet.
    - Uses TCP reset frames to disable specific traffic flows.
    - Not applicable for UDP-based traffic.

- **In-Line Deployment:**
    - Blocks traffic in real-time, preventing malicious traffic from entering the network.

## IPS Detection Mechanisms

- **Signature-Based:**
    - Matches traffic against known signatures.
    - Example: Signature for the Conficker worm.

- **Anomaly-Based:**
    - Examines normal traffic patterns.
    - Blocks abnormal traffic based on deviations from the norm.

- **Behavior-Based:**
    - Recognizes certain types of behavior.
    - Identifies anomalies even without specific signatures.
    - Example: Recognizing SQL injection based on unusual behavior.

- **Advanced Techniques:**
    - Uses big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
    - Understands network behavior broadly.
    - Identifies malicious software based on extensive data and intelligence.

In conclusion, IDS and IPS are vital components for network security, with IPS providing real-time blocking capabilities to prevent malicious traffic from compromising the network. The choice between out-of-band and in-line deployment depends on the specific security requirements and objectives of the network. Detection mechanisms range from signature-based to advanced techniques involving AI and machine learning.
