# IT Security and Network Segmentation

## Segmentation Techniques

- **Physical Segmentation:**
	- Physically separate devices to limit communication.
	- Examples include using different switches or air-gapped environments.

- **Logical Segmentation (VLANs):**
	- Create logical separation within the same device.
	- Uses VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to prevent direct communication.
	- Maintains security by controlling access between segments.

- **Virtual Segmentation:**
	- Implement virtual systems to segment applications.
	- Useful for high-bandwidth applications with specific throughput requirements.

- **Segmentation for Security:**
	- Segregate sensitive devices (e.g., database servers) from regular users.
	- Adhere to legal requirements or industry regulations (e.g., PCI compliance).

## VLANs and Logical Segmentation

- **VLAN Implementation:**
	- Achieves logical separation within the same physical device.
	- Prevents direct communication between segments without a router or similar device.
	- Offers flexibility compared to physical segmentation.

- **Challenges of Physical Segmentation:**
	- Requires separate maintenance, upgrades, and power for each switch.
	- May result in underutilized interfaces and increased costs.

## Screened Subnet (DMZ) and Extranet

- **Screened Subnet (DMZ):**
	- Separate network for internet-facing services.
	- Provides access to services without compromising the internal network.
	- Users connect to services on the screened subnet rather than the internal network.

- **Extranet:**
	- Similar to a screened subnet but designed for partners, vendors, and suppliers.
	- Often involves additional authentication to restrict access from the internet.

## Intranet and Data Center Segmentation

- **Intranet:**
	- Accessible only from the internal network.
	- Contains company announcements, employee documents, and private company information.
	- Accessed from internal networks or through VPN connections.

- **Data Center Traffic Flows:**
	- **East-West Traffic:** Internal communication within the data center.
	- **North-South Traffic:** Traffic inbound or outbound from the data center to external sources.

- **Zero Trust Model:**
	- Assumes every device, application, and data flow is untrusted.
	- Requires additional authentication, encryption, and security controls even within the network.

- **Security Controls in Data Centers:**
	- Implement multifactor authentication, encryption, and additional permissions.
	- Adopt a zero-trust approach to enhance security inside the network.
