# Uses of Digital Certificates

## Introduction

In previous videos, we explored the content of digital certificates. However, in this video, we will delve into the various applications and scenarios where these digital certificates find use.

## Web Server Encryption with Domain Validation Certificates (DV)

- **DV Certificates:**
	- Indicated by a lock symbol in the browser's address bar.
	- Demonstrates control over the connected domain, ensuring trust in website legitimacy.

- **Extended Validation Certificates (EV):**
	- Additional checks by the certificate authority.
	- Displays the certificate owner's name in the browser bar, marked in green.

## Subject Alternative Name (SAN) and Wildcard Certificates

- **SAN Extension:**
	- Adds multiple DNS names to the certificate configuration.
	- Commonly used by services like Cloudflare for supporting multiple sites with a single certificate.

- **Wildcard Certificates:**
	- Designated with an asterisk `(*)` in the SAN field.
	- Supports multiple hosts under a specific DNS, enhancing flexibility.

## Code Signing Certificates for Software Distribution

- **Code Signing Certificates:**
	- Validates software integrity during installation.
	- Enables users to verify that the distributed software is unchanged.

## Root Certificate in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

- **Root Certificate:**
	- Initiates signatures for intermediate and leaf CA certificates.
	- Critical for maintaining the integrity of the entire PKI.

## Self-Signed Certificates in Internal PKI

- **Self-Signed Certificates:**
	- Created and signed internally.
	- Common in organizations with a large number of internal servers.

- **Distribution of CA Certificates:**
	- Ensures trust in internal certificates.
	- Devices need to trust the internal certificate authority.

## Machine or Computer Certificates for Device Trustworthiness

- **Device Trustworthiness:**
	- Validates devices connecting to the network.
	- Common in VPN scenarios for additional authentication.

## Email Certificates for Encryption and Digital Signatures

- **Email Certificates:**
	- Facilitate encryption and digital signatures in email communication.
	- Enhances message integrity and provides non-repudiation.

## User Certificates for Authentication

- **User Certificates:**
	- Integrated into identification cards.
	- Used as an additional authentication factor, often with smart card technology.

## Conclusion

Digital certificates serve a myriad of purposes, ranging from securing web communication to validating software integrity and enhancing authentication across various scenarios.
