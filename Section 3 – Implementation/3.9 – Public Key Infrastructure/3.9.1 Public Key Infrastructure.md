# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## Introduction

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a comprehensive process overseeing various aspects of digital certificates. It encompasses policies, procedures, and the underlying hardware and software infrastructure related to digital certificates. The PKI life cycle involves creation, distribution, usage, and revocation.

## PKI Implementation

Creating a PKI for an organization is a significant undertaking involving multiple stakeholders. Daily PKI operations often revolve around certificate creation, key management, secure distribution, and occasional revocation. The Certificate Authority (CA) is at the center of these activities, creating the foundation of trust for all certificates.

## PKI Administrator Responsibilities

Managing PKI entails several responsibilities for the administrator:
- **Key Creation:**
	- Generate cryptographic keys with specified strength and cipher.
- **Certificate Generation:**
	- Produce certificates associating keys with specific users or devices.
- **Secure Key Distribution:**
	- Safely and securely distribute cryptographic keys to intended users or devices.
- **Revocation Management:**
	- Handle the revocation process when a key compromise occurs.

## Trust in PKI

Trust in digital certificates is established through various means:
- **Certificate Authority:**
	- The CA's digital signature provides a central point of trust.
- **Web of Trust:**
	- Users vouch for each other's certificates in the absence of a central CA.

## Certificate Creation

The creation of digital certificates involves different methods:
- **Windows Domain Services:**
	- Built-in certificate creation in the Windows operating system.
- **Third-Party Options:**
	- Various third-party tools for certificate creation on Linux or Mac OS.

## Commercial Certificate Authorities

Commercial CAs facilitate trust by allowing the purchase of certificates:
- **Certificate Purchase Process:**
	- Local key pair generation, submission of public key (CSR) to CA, and signing of the certificate.
- **Trusted Authorities:**
	- Browsers and operating systems maintain a list of trusted commercial CAs.

## Internal Certificate Authority

Organizations may become their own Certificate Authority:
- **Internal CA Benefits:**
	- Easier and cost-effective management for in-house applications.
	- Windows Certificate Services or third-party tools like open CA.

## Certificate Hierarchy

Most organizations employ a hierarchy of CAs:
- **Root CA:**
	- Top-level CA in the hierarchy.
- **Intermediate CA:**
	- Positioned between the root and leaf CAs.
- **Leaf CA:**
	- Issues certificates to end entities.

## Registration Authority (RA)

In larger organizations, roles like RA complement CA management:
- **Validation Process:**
	- RA identifies requesters, performs validation, and decides on certificate signing.
- **Revocation Responsibilities:**
	- Manages revocations and ensures the overall integrity of the PKI.

## Certificate Attributes

Certificates contain various attributes:
- **Common Name (CN):**
	- Fully Qualified Domain Name associated with the certificate.
- **Subject Alternate Name (SAN):**
	- Allows specifying additional hosts in the certificate.

## Certificate Expiration and Revocation

Certificates have a finite validity period:
- **Expiration Date:**
	- Typically ranging from 1 to 3 months for enhanced security.
- **Revocation Methods:**
	- Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

## Conclusion

PKI serves as a critical component in establishing a secure digital environment. Effective management, from key creation to revocation, ensures the integrity and trustworthiness of digital certificates. Multiple validation methods, including CRLs and OCSP, further enhance the security posture of a PKI.
