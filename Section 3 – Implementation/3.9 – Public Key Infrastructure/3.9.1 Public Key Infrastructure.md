# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## Overview

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) involves managing various aspects of digital certificates, covering policies, procedures, hardware, software, and the entire certificate lifecycle, from creation to revocation.

## PKI Implementation

Implementing PKI for an organization is a complex undertaking, involving collaboration across different departments. Daily tasks for PKI administrators often include creating certificates, associating them with users or devices, and managing the Certificate Authority (CA).

## Responsibilities of PKI Administrator

- PKI administrators have diverse responsibilities, including:
	- Creating keys with specific strengths and ciphers.
	- Generating certificates to associate keys with users.
	- Securely distributing keys to users.
	- Managing key storage and ensuring proper usage.
	- Handling key revocation when necessary.

## Certificate Creation and Distribution

- **Creation Process:**
	- Keys and certificates are created with specific attributes.
	- Certificates often include a digital signature from the CA.

- **Distribution:**
	- Certificates are distributed to users/devices.
	- Commercial CAs provide trusted certificates for external connections.

## Internal Certificate Authority

- **In-House CA:**
	- Organizations can be their own CA for internal certificates.
	- Internal CA simplifies the certificate creation process.

- **Internal CA Management:**
	- Windows domain services or third-party options can manage internal CA.
	- Internal CA is essential for large-scale organizations.

## Certificate Authority Hierarchy

- **Hierarchy Overview:**
	- Root CA, Intermediate CA, and Leaf CA structure.
	- Distribution of certificate management across multiple CAs.

- **Benefits:**
	- Easier management in case of compromise.
	- Enhanced security and load distribution.

## Registration Authority (RA)

- **RA Functionality:**
	- Identifies and validates certificate requesters.
	- Determines whether a certificate should be signed.
	- Manages revocations and certificate renewals.

## Certificate Attributes

- **Common Name (CN):**
	- Fully Qualified Domain Name associated with the certificate.
	- Critical for matching the certificate with the intended use.

- **Subject Alternate Name (SAN):**
	- Additional hosts associated with the certificate.
	- Useful for sites with multiple names.

## Certificate Expiration and Renewal

- **Expiration:**
	- Certificates have a defined expiration date.
	- Shorter lifetimes enhance security.

- **Renewal Process:**
	- Owners need to renew certificates before expiration.
	- Maximum expiration period set by browsers.

## Certificate Revocation

- **Revocation Methods:**
	- Certificate Revocation List (CRL).
	- Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

- **CRL:**
	- Large list of revoked certificates maintained by the CA.
	- Downloaded by clients to check for revocations.

- **OCSP:**
	- Efficient method for real-time certificate status checks.
	- Performed by browsers to an OCSP responder.

## Conclusion

PKI is fundamental for establishing trust through digital certificates. PKI administrators play a crucial role in ensuring the secure creation, distribution, and management of certificates, contributing to the overall cybersecurity posture of the organization.
