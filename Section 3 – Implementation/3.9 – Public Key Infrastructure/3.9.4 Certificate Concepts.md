# Managing Certificate Authorities and Trust Relationships

## Protecting Certificate Authorities

- **CA Security:**
	- Critical to prevent compromise of CA or associated keys.
	- Compromise could lead to distrust of signed keys.
	- Separation of online and offline CAs helps limit exposure.
	- Storing root CA securely protects against compromise.

## Certificate Revocation and OCSP Stapling

- **Checking Revocation:**
	- Challenge in determining if a certificate is revoked.
	- OCSP stapling allows local server validation.
	- Status information stapled into SSL/TLS handshake.
	- Provides local validation without constant checks with CA.

## Certificate Pinning for Trust Verification

- **Certificate Pinning:**
	- Compiling or adding certificates to applications.
	- Compares internal certificate with the one on the server.
	- Mismatch results in error message or application shutdown.
	- Ensures direct communication with the intended server.

## Designing Certificate Authority Structures

- **Hierarchical Structure:**
	- Common model with root, intermediate, and leaf CAs.
	- Limits impact of compromise to a specific CA level.
	- Easier to manage and replace compromised leaf CAs.

- **Mesh Structure:**
	- Every CA trusts every other CA.
	- Scalability concerns with a large number of CAs.
	- Less common due to management challenges.

- **Web of Trust in PGP:**
	- No central CA; based on a web of trust.
	- Certificates signed by people you know.
	- Trust association based on signatures from known individuals.

## Mutual Authentication and Third-Party Key Escrow

- **Mutual Authentication:**
	- Both server and client authenticate each other.
	- Ensures mutual trust in a communication session.

- **Key Escrow:**
	- Third party holds decryption keys.
	- Controlled access based on specific processes.
	- Legal requirements may be necessary for key access.

## Chain of Trust for Certificate Validation

- **Chain of Trust:**
	- Validates intermediate CAs to the root CA.
	- SSL certificate -> Intermediate CA -> Root CA.
	- Check the details of the certificate in the browser for the chain.

- **Adding Chain Certificates:**
	- Admins need to add chain certificates on web servers.
	- Failure to include chain certs may cause browser errors.
	- Chain includes certificates between the server and root CA.
