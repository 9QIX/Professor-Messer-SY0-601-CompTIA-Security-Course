# Federation and Authentication Protocols

## Federation for Access Management

Federation allows users to access a network or service using credentials from a different service, avoiding the need to create additional login credentials. This approach is useful for local network users as well as third-party individuals such as partners or customers.

- **Third-Party Authentication:**
	- Users utilize credentials from another service.
	- Enables access to resources without additional local credentials.

- **Trust Relationships:**
	- Requires a pre-existing relationship and trust between the local site and third-party services.
	- Configuration steps facilitate third-party authentication.

## SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)

SAML is a standard used for both authentication and authorization to access third-party resources. However, its use in mobile applications is limited, and newer protocols are gaining popularity.

- **SAML Process:**
	- Browser attempts to access a third-party site.
	- Receives a signed and encrypted SAML request.
	- Communicates with an authorization server using login credentials.
	- Obtains a SAML token for successful authentication.
	- Presents the token to the third-party site for access.

- **Limitations and Declining Use:**
	- Not designed for mobile applications accessing resources from multiple devices.
	- Usage may decline in favor of newer protocols.

## OAuth and OpenID Connect

OAuth is a framework designed to control third-party access to resources, determining the types of data accessible by the application. OpenID Connect, often used in conjunction with OAuth, provides authentication functionality.

- **OAuth Framework:**
	- Developed by companies like Google and Twitter.
	- Controls third-party application access to resources.

- **OpenID Connect:**
	- Offers authentication functionality.
	- Often used in conjunction with OAuth for comprehensive access management.

- **Industry Support:**
	- Widely supported by various platforms, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

## Authorization Between Applications

In scenarios where third-party applications require access to data from different sites, authorization frameworks like OAuth come into play. Users can control the level of access granted to these applications without revealing login credentials.

- **Authorization Framework Example:**
	- Zapier requesting access to Google Drive.
	- User initiates the process, specifying access permissions.
	- Removal of access is simple by revoking authorization keys.

## Conclusion

Understanding federation and authentication protocols such as SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect provides options for secure access management. The choice of protocol may depend on the specific use case, support in the industry, and the security requirements of the network or service.
