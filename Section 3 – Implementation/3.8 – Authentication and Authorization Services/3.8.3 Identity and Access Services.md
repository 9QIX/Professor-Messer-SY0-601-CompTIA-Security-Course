# Authentication Authorization and Accounting Protocols

## RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service)

RADIUS is a widely used authentication, authorization, and accounting protocol, despite its name implying dial-in services. Commonly employed in local and wide area networks, RADIUS centralizes user authentication for various network devices.

- **Versatility of RADIUS:**
	- Suitable for VPN concentrators, switches, routers, and more.
	- Widely supported on various operating systems.

## TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System) and TACACS+

TACACS, initially designed for dial-up lines, evolved into TACACS+ with added support for accounting and auditing. Although an older authentication method, it remains in use, particularly in Cisco environments.

- **Evolution to TACACS+:**
	- Extended version with enhanced features.
	- Commonly used in Cisco devices for authentication.

## Kerberos Authentication

Kerberos provides a more complex yet robust authentication method, featuring single sign-on capabilities. It offers mutual authentication, preventing replay attacks and man-in-the-middle threats.

- **Mutual Authentication:**
	- Authenticates both the client and the server.
	- Enables single sign-on for accessing various resources.

- **Ticketing System:**
	- Uses cryptographic tickets for authentication.
	- Centralized Authentication server issues service tickets for resource access.

## Choosing Authentication Methods

The choice between RADIUS, TACACS+, and Kerberos often depends on the device being connected to and its supported protocols. Network administrators may use different methods based on the specific requirements of the services they manage.

- **Service-Specific Authentication:**
	- VPN concentrators may utilize RADIUS.
	- Cisco devices commonly support TACACS+.
	- Microsoft networks default to Kerberos.

## 802.1X and Network Access Control (NAC)

802.1X, often referred to as port-based Network Access Control (NAC), provides a preventive approach to network access. Integrated with EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol), it prompts users for credentials before granting access.

- **Versatility of 802.1X:**
	- Used in both wireless and wired network authentication.
	- Leverages EAP framework for various authentication protocols.

- **Back-End Authentication Services:**
	- Interfaces with RADIUS, LDAP, TACACS+, Kerberos, or other authentication servers.
	- Ensures proper user access through authentication checks.

## Conclusion

Understanding the strengths and use cases of RADIUS, TACACS+, Kerberos, and 802.1X/NAC helps network administrators make informed decisions based on the specific requirements of their network devices and services.
