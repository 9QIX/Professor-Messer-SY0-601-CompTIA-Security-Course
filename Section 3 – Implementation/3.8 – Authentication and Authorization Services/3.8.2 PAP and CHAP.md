# Network Authentication Protocols: PAP and CHAP

## Introduction

Authentication is crucial for secure network access, especially in scenarios involving remote clients connecting to internal servers through VPN concentrators. Two common authentication protocols, Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), address this need.

## Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)

PAP is a basic authentication method where the client sends the username and password in clear text to the server for verification. Originally designed for dial-up connections, PAP lacks encryption, making it a less secure choice for modern networks.

- **Authentication Process:**
	- Username and password sent in clear text.
	- PAP server authenticates and responds with approval or disapproval.

- **Security Concerns:**
	- No encryption for password exchange.
	- Vulnerable to eavesdropping and interception.

## Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

CHAP enhances security by using an encrypted challenge-response mechanism. The server sends a challenge to the client, which combines it with a password hash for authentication. This three-way handshake occurs at the beginning and intermittently during the active session.

- **Three-Way Handshake:**
	- Server sends a challenge.
	- Client combines challenge with password hash.
	- Server validates the response for authentication.

- **Enhanced Security:**
	- Challenge-response mechanism.
	- Password not sent in clear text.

- **MS-CHAP and MS-CHAP V2:**
	- Microsoft's implementation of CHAP.
	- MS-CHAP V2 is the latest version.
	- Weak encryption using the data encryption standard (DES).

## Conclusion

While PAP provides a basic authentication method, CHAP offers enhanced security with its encrypted challenge-response mechanism. However, MS-CHAP and MS-CHAP V2, despite being Microsoft's implementations, are considered outdated and insecure. Organizations now prefer more secure authentication methods such as L2TP, IPsec, 802.1X, or other modern protocols.
