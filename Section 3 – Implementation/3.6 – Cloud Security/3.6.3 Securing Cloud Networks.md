# Cloud Networking and Security

In cloud-based applications, effective networking and security measures are essential. Here's an overview of key considerations:

## Networking in the Cloud

- **Public vs. Private Clouds:**
	- **Public Cloud:**
		- Accessible from anywhere on the internet.
		- Applications open to the public.
	- **Private Cloud:**
		- Often requires a VPN for access.
		- Offers privacy with internal/private IP addressing.
	- **Hybrid Cloud:**
		- Combine internal cloud resources with external
		- May combine both public and private subnets

- **Virtual Infrastructure:**
	- **Virtual Switches and Routers:**
		- Configured similarly to physical devices.
		- Created on-demand with rapid elasticity.

- **Segmentation with Subnets:**
	- Use public and private subnets.
	- Segment application components for added security.

## Security Measures

- **Segmentation and Privacy:**
	- Differentiate public and private subnets.
	- Enable communication within the application while restricting external access.

- **Additional Security Controls:**
	- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
		- Inspects inbound and outbound communication.
		- Ensures protection against malicious data.
	- **Next-Generation Firewall:**
		- Sets up subnets for routing.
		- Includes intrusion prevention capabilities.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
	- **API Gateway Security:**
		- Monitor API calls to identify and prevent attacks.
		- Verify if API calls are legitimate and coming from the client.

- **API Monitoring:**
	- **Monitoring API Queries:**
		- Review API queries from the gateway.
		- Monitor data flow between microservices and databases.

Implementing these networking and security measures ensures the reliability, privacy, and integrity of cloud-based applications. Regular monitoring and proactive security measures are crucial in maintaining a robust cloud infrastructure.
