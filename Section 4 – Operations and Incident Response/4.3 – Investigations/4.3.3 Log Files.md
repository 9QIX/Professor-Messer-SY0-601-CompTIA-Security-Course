# Network Device Logs and Security

## Introduction

There are various devices connected to our networking infrastructure that provide feedback about network activities. Devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, VPN concentrators, and others generate log files containing valuable information.

## Switch Logs

- **Interface Status:**
	- Switch log example indicating interfaces going up and down.

- **Security Information:**
	- TCP SYN traffic to the local system automatically blocked for 60 seconds.

## Router Logs

- **Router Updates:**
	- Authentication issues, VPN concentrator activities, and network security events.

- **TCP SYN Attack:**
	- Indication of a network security issue.

## Operating System Logs

- **Extensive Information:**
	- Operating system logs contain details about OS, file system, and applications.

- **Event Viewer (Windows):**
	- Over 7,000 events; tools for filtering and viewing data in different ways.

- **Application Logs:**
	- Many applications maintain logs; details about application performance.

## Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM)

- **Consolidation:**
	- Log files from various devices can be consolidated in a SIEM for centralized analysis.

- **Emphasis on Security:**
	- Focus on security log information, including traffic flows, exploits, blocked URL categories, and DNS sinkhole traffic.

## Firewall Logs

- **Allowed/Blocked Traffic:**
	- Firewall logs reveal allowed or blocked traffic flows.

- **IPv6 Packets Blocked:**
	- Firewall log example showing blocked IPv6 packets.

- **Web Application Firewall:**
	- Details about application-level attacks, e.g., cross-site scripting and SQL injections.

## Web Server Logs

- **Visitor Information:**
	- Extensive log detailing connections to a web server, viewed pages, and errors.

- **Security Insights:**
	- Identify potential attacks or vulnerabilities through log analysis.

## DNS Server Logs

- **Query Information:**
	- DNS server logs reveal queries, IP addresses, and fully-qualified domain names.

- **Malicious Site Indicators:**
	- Identify potential infections or connection attempts to known malicious sites.

## Authentication Logs

- **Authentication Attempts:**
	- Log files show successful and failed authentication attempts.

- **Brute Force Attacks:**
	- Identify and block brute force attacks through log analysis.

## On-Demand Logs

- **Memory Dump Files:**
	- Create dump files on demand, helpful for resolving application issues.

- **Creating Dump Files in Windows:**
	- Task Manager allows the creation of memory dump files.

## Voice over IP (VoIP) Logs

- **Call Manager Logs:**
	- Inbound/outbound call details, endpoint information, and security insights.

- **Session Initiation Protocol (SIP):**
	- Detailed log information for call setup, management, and tear down.

- **Security Alerts:**
	- Alarms for unusual call activities or security-related events.

In various network environments, logs from different devices provide crucial insights into network activities, security events, and potential vulnerabilities. Proper log analysis, whether done individually or consolidated in a SIEM, allows for effective network monitoring and security management.
