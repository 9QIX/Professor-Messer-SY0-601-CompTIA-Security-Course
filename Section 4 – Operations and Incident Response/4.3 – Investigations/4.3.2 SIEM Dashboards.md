# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

## Overview

S-I-E-M, or SIEM, stands for Security Information and Event Management. This is usually a device that is logging information from many different resources on the network and consolidating all of those logs back to one single reporting tool.

This allows us to perform analysis of the data to create security alerts and real-time information about what’s happening on the network right now. Since we have collected all of this log information, we’re aggregating it into one place and creating long-term storage so that we can create extensive reports over a long period of time.

There’s also the ability to correlate different types of data together. We’re bringing together data from firewalls, servers, switches, routers, and other devices on the network. This allows us to correlate data together that normally would be completely separate.

And of course, if we have some type of security event, we can go back through these logs to determine what happened during that time frame and what other details can we gather about this specific security issue.

## Data Collection

- **Source Types:**
	- Gather log files from operating systems like Windows or Linux.
	- Collect log files from switches, routers, firewalls, and other network devices.
	- Utilize third-party sensors (e.g., NetFlow) for information about traffic flows.

- **Database Management:**
	- Use a SIEM capable of parsing and categorizing data.
	- Categorize log entries as informational, warning, or urgent.

## Trend Analysis

- **Long-Term Data Analysis:**
	- Capture information over a long period for trend analysis.
	- Identify spikes in data for security events or network usage variations.

- **Proactive Alerting:**
	- SIEM intelligence proactively provides alarming and alerting.
	- Drill down into raw data to create reports and view event details.

## Correlation of Data Types

- **Standardized Information:**
	- Correlate different data types into a standardized set of information.
	- Explore relationships between source/destination IP addresses, users, and source types.

## Live Demonstration

- **Connected SIEM:**
	- Connected to a SIEM with 339,000 events over five years.
	- Latest event occurred two days ago.

- **Search Functionality:**
	- Perform a search for the term "fail" and "password" to analyze authentication failures.
	- Drill down into log entries for details, including Microsoft authentication, server names, etc.

- **Incident Summarization:**
	- Summarize incident reports based on source types (e.g., 2,400 Windows authentication instances, Linux devices, database audit, secure file service).

- **Destination Analysis:**
	- Analyze destinations of authentication failures.
	- Identify that 57% of events were to the corp file server, revealing potential security issues.

By efficiently searching through the SIEM database, organizations can quickly identify and respond to security events, such as authentication failures, and gain valuable insights into network activity.
