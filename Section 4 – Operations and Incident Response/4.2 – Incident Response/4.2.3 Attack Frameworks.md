# Frameworks for IT Security Professionals

As an IT security professional responsible for protecting your network, the multitude and diversity of cyber attacks can pose significant challenges. Understanding the types of attacks, formulating effective responses, and implementing preventive measures are crucial aspects of your role. Here are key frameworks that can aid you in this process:

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework

- **Overview:**
	- Developed by MITRE Corporation.
	- Available at [attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org/).

- **Purpose:**
	- Identify attack categories, specific intrusions, and attacker movement.
	- Understand attack techniques and implement security measures.

- **Example:**
	- Explore reconnaissance phase.
		- Active scanning: Learn about IP block scanning and vulnerability scanning.
		- Mitigation: Implement pre-compromise mitigation strategies.

- **Extensive Information:**
	- Detailed information on brute force attacks (password guessing, cracking, spraying, credential stuffing).
	- Mitigation techniques, detection methods, and references.

## Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

- **Origin:**
	- Designed by the U.S. federal government intelligence community.
	- [More Information](https://www.dtic.mil/).

- **Focus:**
	- Scientific principles applied to intrusion analysis.
	- Emphasizes measurement, testability, and repeatability.

- **Model Components:**
	- Adversary, capability, victim, and infrastructure.
	- Relationships between these components.

- **Application:**
	- Understand relationships in an intrusion scenario.
	- Fill in details and documentation to comprehend the intrusion.
	- Identify ways to prevent future occurrences.

## Cyber Kill Chain

- **Concept:**
	- Military concept adapted for cybersecurity.
	- Describes the stages of a cyber attack.

- **Phases:**
	- **Reconnaissance:**
		- Gather intelligence about the target.
	- **Weaponization:**
		- Develop a payload to exploit vulnerabilities.
	- **Delivery:**
		- Transmit the payload to the victim.
	- **Exploit:**
		- Install malware and create backdoors.
	- **Installation**
		- Malware is installed into the operating system
	- **Command and Control:**
		- Establish communication channels.
	- **Actions on Objectives:**
		- Execute the attacker's objectives.

- **Application:**
	- Provides a structured view of the attack lifecycle.
	- Enables proactive defense strategies.

Each framework offers a unique perspective on IT security, providing valuable insights for both proactive defense and post-incident analysis. Leveraging these frameworks enhances your ability to safeguard your network and respond effectively to cyber threats.
