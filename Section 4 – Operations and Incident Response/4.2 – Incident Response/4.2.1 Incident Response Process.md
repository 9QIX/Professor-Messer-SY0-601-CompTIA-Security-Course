# Incident Response in Cybersecurity

As a security professional, responding to security events is a crucial responsibility. Incidents like malware infections, distributed denial of service attacks, data breaches, or internal security lapses demand a well-prepared incident response team.

## Incident Response Team

- **Composition:**
	- IT management, compliance officers, technical staff, community users, and more.
	- Inclusive of management, public relations, application developers, etc.

- **NIST Guidelines:**
	- Refer to NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2 for a comprehensive incident handling guide.
	- Encompasses preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities.

## Preparation for Incident Response

- **Key Components:**
	- Communication methods and contact lists for immediate response.
	- Documentation of hardware, software tools, and data capture procedures.
	- Network documentation to understand data locations.
	- Creation of hash values for stored evidence.
	- Policies and procedures for a standardized response.

- **Mitigation Planning:**
	- Preparedness includes clean OS and application images.
	- Clearly defined policies and procedures for incident handling.

## Detection of Security Incidents

- **Monitoring Methods:**
	- Regular monitoring for potential indicators like web server logs, vulnerability assessments, or threat intelligence.
	- Identification of increased threat potential through various channels.

- **Incident Indicators:**
	- Alerts from intrusion prevention systems (IPS) for attacks.
	- Anti-malware or antivirus system alerts.
	- File integrity monitoring alerts.
	- Anomalies in network traffic.

## Containment and Analysis

- **Isolation:**
	- Isolate and contain security incidents immediately.
	- Use sandboxes for analysis, ensuring an isolated environment for malware.

- **Challenges:**
	- Some malware may behave differently in a sandbox.
	- Specific malware may recognize sandbox conditions and alter behavior.

## Recovery and Reconstitution

- **Eradication of Malware:**
	- Remove malware through system rebuild or restoration from a known good backup.
	- Address vulnerabilities that led to the incident.

- **Backup Importance:**
	- Quick recovery enabled by having backups.
	- Rebuilding without a backup may result in data loss.

- **Network Lockdown:**
	- Implement measures to prevent further attacks.
	- Secure the perimeter to avoid repeated incidents.

- **Reconstitution Challenges:**
	- Large networks may require a phased approach.
	- Prioritize changes and updates for efficient recovery.

## Post-Incident Analysis

- **Documentation:**
	- Detailed documentation of incident timeline and response.
	- Evaluation of pre-incident plans' effectiveness during the actual incident.

- **Post-Incident Meeting:**
	- Collaborative review of incident response processes.
	- Capture lessons learned, strengths, and areas for improvement.

- **Continuous Improvement:**
	- Update alarms and alerts based on incident insights.
	- Adjust response plans for better future execution.

Handling incidents effectively involves a continuous cycle of preparation, detection, containment, recovery, and analysis for ongoing improvement.
