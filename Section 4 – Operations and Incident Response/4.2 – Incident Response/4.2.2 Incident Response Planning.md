# Security Incident Planning

Usually when we talk about security incidents, itâ€™s usually after the fact, when one has already occurred. But much of your work is going to be done well before an incident ever occurs in your environment. And there are a number of things you can do prior to an incident occurring that can help you with the planning process.

## Performing Exercises

- **Frequency:**
    - These exercises can be scheduled once a year, twice a year, or more.
    - Ensure everyone becomes accustomed to what they would do during an incident.

- **Production Network Impact:**
    - Be careful not to affect anything related to production networks during exercises.
    - Plan for limited time despite potential weeks or months required to resolve real incidents.

## Tabletop Exercises

- **Definition:**
    - Full-scale drills can be time-consuming and costly.
    - Logistical and procedural issues can be identified without physical drills.

- **Purpose:**
    - Tabletop exercises involve discussions and scenario walkthroughs.
    - Identify and resolve process and procedure problems before actual incidents.

## Walkthroughs and Simulations

- **Walkthroughs:**
    - Test all processes and procedures with management and all responders.
    - Use all tools available to you in a simulated incident scenario.

- **Simulations:**
    - Pretend events like phishing attacks to observe responses.
    - Evaluate anti-phishing mechanisms and adjust filters accordingly.

## Stakeholder Involvement

- **Relationship Building:**
    - Maintain good relationships with stakeholders.
    - Involve them in the planning process for these types of security events.

- **Communication:**
    - Ongoing communication and meetings are crucial.
    - Ensure stakeholders are involved in security exercises.

## Incident Response Contacts

- **Contact List:**
    - Maintain an up-to-date contact list.
    - Include CIO, Head of Information Security, internal response teams, HR, PR, legal, and external resources if needed.

## Planning for Disasters

- **Disaster Types:**
    - Plan for various disasters like floods, fires, system failures, or human-induced issues.
    - Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.

- **Data Recovery:**
    - Consider data storage locations and recovery procedures.
    - Ensure applications and personnel are ready for recovery.

## Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP)

- **Alternative Processes:**
    - Plan for manual transactions and alternative processes.
    - Document contingencies well before a security event occurs.

## Incident Response Team

- **Composition:**
    - Incident Response Team may not be a separate department.
    - Trained professionals to respond to security incidents.

- **Incident Types:**
    - Determine incident types and appropriate responses.
    - Small groups for virus infections, larger groups for ransomware, or DDoS attacks.

## Data Backups

- **Backup Importance:**
    - Data is some of the most valuable assets.
    - Ensure backups of everything and understand data location and priority.

- **Regulatory Compliance:**
    - Some data may have regulatory storage requirements.
    - Ensure compliance with storage and backup policies.

Handling incidents requires thorough planning, involving stakeholders, performing exercises, and maintaining effective communication throughout the incident response cycle.
