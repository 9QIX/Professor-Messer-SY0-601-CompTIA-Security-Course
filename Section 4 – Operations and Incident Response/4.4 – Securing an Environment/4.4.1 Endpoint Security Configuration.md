# Endpoint Security and Application Control

## Introduction to Endpoints

- **Definition:**
	- Endpoints refer to the devices used for daily tasks, including desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
	- Vulnerabilities include malware, OS vulnerabilities, and user actions circumventing security controls.

- **Security Responsibility:**
	- IT security teams monitor and protect endpoints.
	- Constant vigilance for alerts and alarms indicating unusual activities.

## Application Control Philosophy

- **Approved List Approach:**
	- Define a list of approved applications for endpoints.
	- Only applications on the list are allowed to run.
	- Highly restrictive, requiring approval for any additions.

- **Blocklist/Deny List Approach:**
	- Specify a list of applications denied from running on endpoints.
	- Users can install any application unless on the deny list.
	- Common in anti-virus/anti-malware software.

## Handling Recognized Threats

- **Quarantine Area:**
	- Endpoint security software removes recognized threats.
	- Places them in a quarantine area where no applications can run.
	- Enables further analysis by the IT security team.

## Control Mechanisms

- **Hash-Based Control:**
	- OS checks executable hashes for permission.
	- Security team updates hashes for new software versions.
	- Hash changes if the application is altered.

- **Digital Signatures:**
	- Applications carry digital signatures linked to developers.
	- Trust decisions based on the digital signature.
	- Trust Microsoft-signed applications, for example.

- **File Location-Based Control:**
	- Limit application permissions to specific folders.
	- Create a trusted area on the storage drive.
	- Restricts malicious software installation locations.

- **Policy-Based Control:**
	- Set policies to allow/disallow based on execution zones.
	- Differentiate private (internal) and public (internet) zones.
	- Applications from public zones may be prohibited.

Endpoint security relies on diverse control mechanisms, from approved and deny lists to hash-based, digital signature, file location-based controls, and policy-based controls, ensuring a secure and monitored environment for daily operations.
