# Network Security Controls and Strategies

## Firewall and Mobile Devices

- **Firewall Capabilities:**
	- Allow/deny applications on the network.
	- Ineffective for mobile devices outside the office.

- **Mobile Device Management (MDM):**
	- Set policies for mobile devices.
	- Ensures protection from malicious software.
  
## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- **Role of DLP:**
	- Identifying and blocking PII transfer.
	- Prevents the loss of sensitive information.

## URL Filtering and Certificates

- **URL Filtering:**
	- Blocks access to known malicious sites.
	- Integrates with third-party blocklists.
	- Example: Detection of phishing sites.

- **Certificates:**
	- Deploy trusted certificates to devices.
	- No access without a trusted certificate.

## Isolation Strategies

- **Device Isolation:**
	- Separate VLANs for devices without proper security posture.
	- Remediation VLANs for updates before full access.

- **Process Isolation:**
	- Restrict network access for suspicious processes.
	- Allows communication for trusted applications.

## Containment Measures

- **Application Containment:**
	- Run applications in isolated sandboxes.
	- Limits interactions, preventing malware spread.

- **Containment Reactivity:**
	- Reactive measures once malware is identified.
	- Disable administrative shares, remote management, and change passwords.

## Segmentation and Internal Network Security

- **Segmentation:**
	- Create segmented networks for different device categories.
	- Prevents lateral movement of threats within the network.

## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

- **SOAR Overview:**
	- Integrates multiple security tools.
	- Based on runbooks with step-by-step instructions.
	- Runbooks combined to form playbooks for broader event responses.
	- Enables automated and dynamic security control adjustments.

Implementing a combination of these network security controls and strategies provides a comprehensive approach to protecting applications and data in various scenarios.
