# Network Reconnaissance and Troubleshooting

## Traceroute Command

The `traceroute` command allows mapping the entire path between two devices to identify routers along the route. In Windows, use the `tracert` command; in Linux, Unix, or macOS, use `traceroute`. The information is obtained through ICMP Time to Live Exceeded error messages.

### Manipulating TTL for Traceroute

- **TTL Parameter:**
	- Traceroute manipulates the Time To Live (TTL) parameter.
	- TTL is a value in the IP packet indicating the maximum hops allowed.
	- Routers generate ICMP Time Exceeded messages when TTL is reached.
	- Some firewalls or routers may filter or not respond to these messages.

### Traceroute Across Operating Systems

- **Protocol and Method Differences:**
	- Windows uses ICMP echo requests (similar to ping).
	- Linux, Unix, macOS may use different protocols and methods.
	- Consider modifying the protocol for compatibility.

### Traceroute Process

- **How Traceroute Works:**
	- Traceroute sends packets with increasing TTL.
	- Routers along the path generate ICMP Time Exceeded messages.
	- The final destination responds with an ICMP echo reply.
	- Some networks may filter ICMP, affecting traceroute results.

### Real-Time Traceroute Example

- **Running Traceroute:**
	- Example using the `traceroute` command to Quad9 DNS provider.
	- Shows each hop's IP address and response times.
	- Highlights potential issues or administrative prohibitions.

## Name Server Query with nslookup and dig

- **Name Server Query:**
	- Use `nslookup` or `dig` to query DNS servers for information.
	- `nslookup` is common but being deprecated; `dig` is a modern alternative.
	- Examples of querying Quad9 DNS for ProfessorMesser.com.

## IP Configuration with ipconfig and ifconfig

- **IP Configuration:**
	- Use `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux, macOS) to check IP details.
	- Provides information on IP address, subnet mask, default gateway.
	- Additional details available using `ipconfig /all` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux).

## Device Reachability with Ping

- **Ping Command:**
	- Use the `ping` command to check device reachability.
	- Sends ICMP echo requests and awaits responses.
	- Interrupt with Ctrl+C for summary; useful for troubleshooting.

## Pathping Command in Windows

- **Pathping Command:**
	- Combines ping and traceroute functionalities.
	- Traceroute to destination with round trip time measurements.
	- Provides statistics on packet loss at each hop.
	- Useful for comprehensive network analysis.

## Network Statistics with netstat

- **Netstat Command:**
	- Use `netstat` to view active connections and network statistics.
	- Different options include `-a`, `-b` (Windows), and `-n`.
	- Examples of viewing active connections and associated binaries.

### ARP Table Exploration

- **ARP Table Exploration:**
	- Use `arp -a` (Windows) to view ARP cache.
	- Displays IP addresses mapped to MAC addresses.
	- Useful for resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses.

## Routing Table Exploration

- **Routing Table Exploration:**
	- View routing tables using `route print` (Windows) or `netstat -r` (Linux, macOS).
	- Identify default routes and specific routes on the device.
	- Example of checking routing tables on Windows and macOS.
