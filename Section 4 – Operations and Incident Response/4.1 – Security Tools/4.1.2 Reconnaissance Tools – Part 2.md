# Reconnaissance Tools and Techniques

## Curl for Web Data Retrieval

### Introduction to Curl
- **Definition:** Curl stands for Client URL or Uniform Resource Locator.
- **Functionality:** Used for accessing web pages, performing FTP, retrieving emails, and more.
- **Data Retrieval:** Grabs raw data from websites and displays it in a terminal.

### Example Usage on ProfessorMesser.com
- **HTTP Request:**
	- Running `curl www.professormesser.com`.
	- Observing a 301 moved permanently message indicating a move to HTTPS.
- **HTTPS Request:**
	- Executing `curl https://www.professormesser.com`.
	- Displays a larger amount of data, representing the site's HTML source code.

## IP Scanning and Reconnaissance

### Overview of IP Scanning
- **Purpose:** Identifying IP addresses and open port numbers on a network.
- **Techniques:** Utilizes ARP, ICMP, TCP acknowledgments, ICMP timestamp requests, etc.
- **Tools:** Mention of popular scanners like Nmap and Hping.

### Hping for Detailed Network Information
- **Enhanced Ping:**
	- Hping extends functionality beyond simple ping commands.
	- Allows customization of packet details, IP information, TCP/UDP details, etc.
	- Caution about potential denial of service, requiring permissions for scanning.

### Nmap for Comprehensive Network Mapping
- **Network Mapper (Nmap):**
	- Scans for open ports, identifies the operating system, and performs service scans.
	- Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE): Enables additional script-based functionality.
- **Example Scan:**
	- Running `sudo nmap -vv` on a router.
	- Provides detailed information about open, closed, and unreachable ports.

## Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Tools

### The Harvester for OSINT
- **OSINT Gathering:**
	- Harvester collects information from various sources like Google, Bing, LinkedIn.
	- Supports DNS brute force to identify additional hosts associated with a domain.
- **Example Usage:**
	- Running `sudo harvester -d example.com -b Bing -l 100` to find emails associated with example.com.

### Consolidating Tools with Sniper
- **Reconnaissance Tool:**
	- Sniper combines multiple tools into a single query for unified results.
	- Caution: Some options can be intrusive; ensure permissions and choose options wisely.
- **Example Query:**
	- Executing `sniper -t example.com -w web`.

### Scanless for Proxy Port Scanning
- **Proxy Port Scanning:**
	- Scanless serves as a proxy, allowing port scans from a different host.
	- Supports various proxy services.
- **Example Proxy Scan:**
	- Scanning `scanme.nmap.org` using scanless with Spider IP as a proxy.

## DNS Enumeration and Vulnerability Scanning

### DNS Enumeration with dnsenum
- **DNS Enumeration Tool:**
	- Dnsenum queries DNS servers and performs brute force to find subdomains.
- **Example Query:**
	- Running `dnsenum example.com -v`.

### Nessus for Vulnerability Scanning
- **Vulnerability Scanner:**
	- Nessus identifies known vulnerabilities, provides extensive reporting.
	- Example scan results on IP address 10.1.10.13, showing critical vulnerabilities.

## Malware Analysis with Cuckoo Sandbox

### Introduction to Cuckoo Sandbox
- **Sandbox Environment:**
	- Cuckoo provides a virtualized environment for running unknown executables.
	- Supports various operating systems for analysis.
- **Functionality:**
	- Analyzes API calls, network traffic, and performs memory analysis.
- **Use Case:**
	- Ideal for evaluating executables before deployment to ensure safety.

Note: Exercise caution when using reconnaissance tools, ensure proper permissions, and be aware of potential security implications.
