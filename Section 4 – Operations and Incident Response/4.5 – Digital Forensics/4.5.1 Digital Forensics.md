# Data Collection in Forensics

## Overview
Data collection in forensics involves gathering information from various sources, prioritizing volatile data first, and proceeding to less volatile data. This ensures capturing time-sensitive information before it's lost. Different types of data require specific collection methods.

## Volatility Levels

1. **CPU Data:**
	- CPU registers and cache.
	- Extremely volatile.

2. **Memory Information:**
	- Router tables, ARP cache, process tables.
	- Volatile but slightly longer duration.

3. **File System Data:**
	- Temporary file systems, stored files.
	- More persistent than memory.

4. **Remote Logging Data:**
	- Information sent to remote logging facility.
	- Retained for an extended period.

5. **Network Configuration:**
	- Physical device configuration, network typology.
	- Least volatile, long-term data.

6. **Archival Data:**
	- Backups and archival media.
	- Information retained for years.

## Hard Drive Imaging

- Power down the system, remove storage drive.
- Use imaging devices with write protection.
- Create a bit-for-bit copy preserving all data.
- Enables analysis of the entire drive content.

## Memory Collection

- **Challenges:**
	- Constantly changing information.
	- Capturing data can alter memory.

- **Methods:**
	- Third-party tools for memory dumps.
	- Capture browsing history, clipboard data, encryption keys, etc.

## Swap or Pagefile

- Temporary storage area in operating systems.
- Stores swapped-out portions of active memory.
- Essential for comprehensive memory analysis.

## Operating System Details

- **Core Files and Libraries:**
	- Compare with known-good files.
	- Analyze for security event details.

- **Real-time Operating System Data:**
	- Logged-in users, open ports, running processes.
	- Valuable for malware or ransomware investigations.

## Mobile Device Forensics

- Use tools to gather data from smartphones or tablets.
- Capture phone calls, contacts, messages, emails, media.
- Connect directly or use backup files.

## Firmware Modification

- Identify if firmware is modified.
- Determine the extent of attacker access.
- Analyze real-time data sent/received by the device.

## Virtual Machine Snapshot

- Capture details from virtual machine snapshots.
- Original snapshot and subsequent incremental updates.
- Provides a complete image of the virtual machine.

## Cache Analysis

- Different types of caches (CPU, disk, browser).
- Temporarily store specialized data for faster access.
- Explore browser cache for visited URLs, page content.

## Network Data Capture

- Observe network connections and raw data transfers.
- Identify sessions created by the OS and applications.
- Leverage packet captures on firewalls or intrusion prevention systems.

## Artifacts

- **Examples:**
	- Logs, flash memory, prefetch cache files, recycle bin.
	- Browser bookmarks, login records.

Data artifacts may be stored in various locations, providing additional insights during forensic analysis.
