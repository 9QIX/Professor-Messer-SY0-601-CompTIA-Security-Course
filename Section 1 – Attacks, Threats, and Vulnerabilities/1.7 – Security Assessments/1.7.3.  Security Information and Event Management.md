# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) in IT Security

## Introduction
Managing the influx of information from log files and event notifications in IT security is facilitated by Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) devices. A SIEM serves as a centralized platform to collect data from diverse network sources, such as log files and real-time security alerts. This information is then stored, allowing for historical analysis, correlation of data, and post-event forensics.

## Syslog Standard for Data Collection
- A SIEM collects data from various devices on the network using the syslog standard.
- Syslog-compatible collectors within the SIEM wait for messages from diverse devices, and the messages are formatted in standard syslog format.

## Storage and Data Types
- SIEMs often allocate terabytes of storage to store extensive log data over extended periods.
- Valuable information for storage includes authentication attempts, VPN and firewall session logs, denied outbound traffic, network utilization trends, and raw packet captures for forensics.

## Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Larger organizations often have a Security Operations Center (SOC) responsible for monitoring SIEMs.
- SOC personnel analyze incoming data, identify security exceptions, and respond to security incidents using the SIEM dashboard.

## Exception Handling and Automation
- Logs added to the SIEM are parsed to identify security exceptions.
- Automated notifications through email, text messages, or ticketing systems alert relevant personnel to identified exceptions.

## Core of SIEM: Log Information
- Log entries from diverse devices, such as Windows systems, are stored in SIEM databases.
- SIEM dashboards provide an overview of logs, including trends, severity, and top reporting devices.

## Analytics in SIEM
- SIEMs leverage various analytics techniques, including big data analytics, user and entity behavior analytics, and sentiment analytics.
- Big data analytics reveal patterns in large and diverse datasets, while behavior analytics assess network usage patterns.
- Sentiment analytics gauge public opinion, influencing security strategies.

## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
- SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response) automates manual and tedious security processes.
- Orchestration manages and automates tasks across diverse security devices dynamically.
- Automation allows for rapid configuration changes, firewall rule modifications, and account permission adjustments.
- Response capabilities enable real-time reactions to security events, mitigating potential threats at the speed of automation.

In conclusion, SIEMs and the integration of SOAR play a crucial role in modern cybersecurity, allowing organizations to efficiently manage, analyze, and respond to security events in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.
