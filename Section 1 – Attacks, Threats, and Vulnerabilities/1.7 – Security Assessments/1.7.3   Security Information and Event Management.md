# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) in IT Security

## Introduction
Managing the influx of information from log files and event notifications in IT security is facilitated by Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) devices. A SIEM serves as a centralized platform to collect data from diverse network sources, such as log files and real-time security alerts. This information is then stored, allowing for historical analysis, correlation of data, and post-event forensics.

## Syslog Standard for Data Collection
- **Syslog Standard:**
	- SIEMs use the syslog standard for collecting data from various network devices.
	- Syslog-compatible collectors within the SIEM wait for messages in the standard syslog format.

- **Storage Requirements:**
	- SIEMs allocate terabytes of storage for storing extensive log data over extended periods.

## Security Operations Center (SOC)
- **SOC Role:**
	- Larger organizations often have a Security Operations Center (SOC) responsible for monitoring SIEMs.
	- SOC personnel analyze incoming data, identify security exceptions, and respond to security incidents using the SIEM dashboard.

- **Exception Handling:**
	- Logs added to the SIEM are parsed to identify security exceptions.
	- Automated notifications through email, text messages, or ticketing systems alert relevant personnel to identified exceptions.

## Core of SIEM: Log Information
- **Log Entries:**
	- Log entries from diverse devices, such as Windows systems, are stored in SIEM databases.
	- SIEM dashboards provide an overview of logs, including trends, severity, and top reporting devices.

## Analytics in SIEM
- **Analytics Techniques:**
	- SIEMs leverage various analytics techniques, including big data analytics, user and entity behavior analytics, and sentiment analytics.
	- Big data analytics reveal patterns in large and diverse datasets, while behavior analytics assess network usage patterns.
	- Sentiment analytics gauge public opinion, influencing security strategies.

## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
- **SOAR Overview:**
	- SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response) automates manual and tedious security processes.
	- Orchestration manages and automates tasks across diverse security devices dynamically.

- **Automation Benefits:**
	- Automation allows for rapid configuration changes, firewall rule modifications, and account permission adjustments.
	- Response capabilities enable real-time reactions to security events, mitigating potential threats at the speed of automation.

In conclusion, SIEMs and the integration of SOAR play a crucial role in modern cybersecurity, allowing organizations to efficiently manage, analyze, and respond to security events in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.
