# Vulnerability Scans in IT Security

## Introduction
In IT security, vulnerability scans play a crucial role in identifying potential weaknesses in operating systems, network devices, and applications. Unlike penetration tests that aim to gain access, vulnerability scans assess the external possibility of unauthorized access to systems.

## Port Scans as a Common Vulnerability Scan
- **Purpose of Port Scans:**
	- Port scans are a common type of vulnerability scan.
	- They identify open ports on devices, revealing potential security vulnerabilities.
  
- **Example of Port Scan:**
	- Analyzing open ports can expose insecure services, such as Telnet running on port 23.
	- This information can be indicative of security risks associated with the exposed service.

## Performing Vulnerability Scans
- **Scope of Vulnerability Scans:**
	- Perform scans on various network-connected devices, including servers, workstations, and laptops.
	- Scans should emulate both external and internal perspectives to comprehensively assess vulnerabilities.

- **Data Collection:**
	- Vulnerability scans collect extensive information about devices.
	- The subsequent analysis requires thorough examination of scan logs to determine appropriate actions.

## Non-Intrusive Nature of Scans
- **Non-Intrusive Scans:**
	- Vulnerability scans are generally non-intrusive, focusing on identifying potential vulnerabilities without exploiting them.
	- The goal is to assess if vulnerabilities exist rather than attempting to compromise systems.

- **Intrusiveness Considerations:**
	- While non-intrusive, scans involve probing port numbers and potential vulnerabilities.
	- Follow-up penetration tests or specific exploit testing can validate identified vulnerabilities.

## Credentialed vs. Non-Credentialed Scans
- **Non-Credentialed Scans:**
	- Simulate an external perspective with no access credentials.
	- Provide insights into potential vulnerabilities visible from the internet.

- **Credentialed Scans:**
	- Simulate an insider perspective with access credentials.
	- Assess vulnerabilities that might be exploitable with partial access to systems.

## Interpreting Scan Results
- **Critical Vulnerabilities:**
	- Examples include OpenSSL weaknesses or unsupported Unix versions.
	- Addressing critical vulnerabilities is imperative to prevent exploitation.

- **Severity Levels:**
	- Vulnerabilities are categorized by severity levels, ranging from critical to informational.
	- Prioritize remediation based on the severity and impact of identified vulnerabilities.

## External Resources and Research
- **CVE Database:**
	- Access the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.
	- Platforms like the National Vulnerability Database provide a centralized resource for vulnerability information.

- **Manufacturer Resources:**
	- Explore security bulletins directly from manufacturers (e.g., Microsoft Security Bulletins).
	- Validate vulnerabilities and apply patches using manufacturer-recommended processes.

## Challenges and False Positives
- **False Positives:**
	- False positives occur when a scan incorrectly identifies a non-existent vulnerability.
	- Distinguish false positives from low severity vulnerabilities and prioritize actions accordingly.

- **False Negatives:**
	- False negatives occur when a scan fails to detect an existing vulnerability.
	- Ensure up-to-date vulnerability databases and collaborate with manufacturers to address false negatives.

## Beyond Formal Vulnerability Scans
- **Configuration Reviews:**
	- Conduct configuration reviews to identify security issues.
	- Inspect firewall settings, antivirus updates, account configurations, and permissions to enhance security posture.

- **Continuous Monitoring:**
	- Regularly review security settings, access controls, and configurations to maintain a proactive security stance.
	- Address misconfigurations promptly to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, vulnerability scans are essential for maintaining a robust security posture. Regular scans, coupled with thorough analysis and prompt remediation, contribute to effective cybersecurity practices.
