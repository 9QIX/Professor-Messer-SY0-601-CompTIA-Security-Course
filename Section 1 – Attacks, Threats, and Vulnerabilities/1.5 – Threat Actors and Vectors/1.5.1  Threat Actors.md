# Threat Actors in Cybersecurity

## Introduction
A threat actor, often referred to as a malicious actor, is an entity responsible for an event impacting the safety of another entity. In cybersecurity, understanding different categories of threat actors and their motivations is crucial for implementing effective defense strategies. This overview explores major threat actor categories and their motivations behind cyber attacks.

## Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)

- **Motivation:** Usually focused on long-term infiltration to achieve specific objectives.
- **Detection Challenge:** APTs can remain undetected for extended periods, averaging 71 to 204 days.

- **Motivation:** May vary, including financial gain, revenge, or espionage.

## Nation State
- **Definition:** Government entities acting as threat actors.
- **Resources:** Governments possess significant resources, hire skilled technologists, and focus on national security.
- **Example:** Stuxnet worm used by the U.S. and Israel to disrupt Iranian nuclear centrifuges.

## Hacktivist
- **Definition:** Activists using hacking skills to achieve political or social goals.
- **Motivation:** Driven by a cause, engaging in activities such as defacing websites or performing denial-of-service attacks.
- **Funding Challenge:** Often relies on external fundraising due to lack of financial gain.

## Script Kiddie

## Shadow IT
- **Definition:** Employees creating their own IT infrastructure outside the official IT department.
- **Motivation:** Perceived restrictions or delays lead to independent IT initiatives.
- **Disadvantages:** Wasted time, security risks, compliance issues, internal dysfunction.

## Competitors
- **Motivation:** Disrupting competitors for strategic advantage.
- **Tactics:** Denial of service, espionage, reputation damage, gaining access to sensitive information.
- **Resources:** Competitors often have significant financial resources to fund cyber attacks.

## Conclusion
Understanding the diverse landscape of threat actors is essential for organizations to develop robust cybersecurity measures. Defenders must stay vigilant, implement best practices, and leverage ethical hacking to proactively address vulnerabilities and protect against potential threats.
