# Cybersecurity Attack Vectors

## Introduction
Understanding attack vectors is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to defend against potential threats. Attack vectors are methods used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks. This overview explores various attack vectors and the importance of securing against them.

## Physical Access
- **Description:** Attackers gain access to hardware, exploiting vulnerabilities directly.
- **Examples:**
	- Booting into administrative mode.
	- Attaching keyloggers to keyboards.
	- Copying files using portable media.
- **Prevention:** Secure data centers, restrict physical access, and implement security measures against keyloggers.

## Wireless Networks
- **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless networks.
- **Considerations:**
	- Secure access points with strong credentials.
	- Guard against rogue access points and evil twin attacks.
	- Keep wireless technologies updated (e.g., WPA2).
- **Vulnerability:** Key reinstallation attacks (e.g., KRACK) on outdated encryption technologies.

## Email
- **Description:** Leveraging email for phishing attacks and malware distribution.
- **Challenges:**
	- Phishing links and social engineering.
	- Malicious attachments.
	- Targeted attacks exploiting user trust.
- **Security Focus:** Implementing robust email security measures.

## Supply Chain
- **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the supply chain to compromise systems.
- **Examples:**
	- Target breach via a compromised vendor.
	- Stuxnet worm disrupting Iran's uranium enrichment.
	- Fake Cisco switches infiltrating networks.
- **Preventive Measures:** Vet suppliers, secure the supply chain, and prioritize supply chain security.

## Social Media
- **Description:** Extracting information from social media platforms for targeted attacks.
- **Risks:**
	- Location tracking and personal information exposure.
	- Social engineering for password reset attacks.
	- Impersonation for unauthorized access.
- **Mitigation:** Be cautious with social media settings, limit public exposure, and educate users.

## Insider Threat
- **Description:** Malicious actions by individuals with internal access.
- **Advantages:**
	- Knowledge of network infrastructure.
	- Targeted attacks based on insider information.
- **Prevention:** Monitoring, access controls, and employee education.

## USB Attacks
- **Description:** Exploiting USB connections to infiltrate systems.
- **Techniques:**
	- Data exfiltration via infected USB drives.
	- USB devices acting as keyboards (hacking on a chip).
- **Security Measures:** Control USB access, use endpoint protection, and educate users on USB risks.

## Cloud-Based Applications
- **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in publicly-facing cloud applications.
- **Considerations:**
	- Secure configurations to protect data.
	- Guard against brute force and phishing attacks.
	- Plan for potential denial-of-service attacks.
- **Security Focus:** Ensure robust cloud application security and monitoring.

## Conclusion
Cybersecurity professionals must continually adapt defenses against evolving attack vectors. Vigilance, education, and implementing comprehensive security measures are critical in safeguarding systems or networks.
