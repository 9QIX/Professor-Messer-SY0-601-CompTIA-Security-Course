# Code Injection Attacks and SQL Injection Example

## Introduction

Code injection attacks occur when attackers insert their own code into an existing data stream, exploiting vulnerabilities often caused by poor programming practices. One prevalent form of code injection is SQL injection, where attackers manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to databases. Understanding and mitigating code injection vulnerabilities are crucial for securing applications.

## Types of Code Injection

- **SQL Injection:**
	- Exploits vulnerabilities in the web front end to gain unauthorized access to a database.
	- Input validation failure allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries.
	- Example: Modifying authentication number input to extract entire database contents.

- **XML Injection:**
	- Malformed XML data is sent to a device to exploit vulnerabilities.
	- Well-written applications validate incoming XML data to prevent injection.

- **LDAP Injection:**
	- Exploits vulnerabilities to inject data into LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) servers.
	- Gaining unauthorized access to LDAP databases may reveal sensitive information.

- **DLL Injection:**
	- Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) injection involves injecting code into an application.
	- Allows execution of injected code in the context of the victim process.
	- Can provide additional rights and capabilities to the attacker.

## SQL Injection Example (WebGoat)

- **Scenario:**
	- Intentionally vulnerable application in WebGoat.
	- Employee authentication using a form with name and authorization number.

- **Exploitation:**
	- Form input validation neglects the authorization number.
	- Attacker injects SQL code (e.g., OR 1 equals 1) to manipulate the query.
	- Result: Unauthorized access to the entire database, including names, departments, and salaries.

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Input Validation:**
	- Implement robust input validation to prevent malicious injections.
	- Validate and sanitize user input to ensure data integrity.

- **Secure Coding Practices:**
	- Adhere to secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities.
	- Regularly update and patch applications to address known security issues.

- **Least Privilege Principle:**
	- Limit application privileges to the minimum necessary for functionality.
	- Reduce the potential impact of a successful injection attack.

Code injection vulnerabilities highlight the importance of proactive security measures and continuous monitoring to identify and address potential risks.
