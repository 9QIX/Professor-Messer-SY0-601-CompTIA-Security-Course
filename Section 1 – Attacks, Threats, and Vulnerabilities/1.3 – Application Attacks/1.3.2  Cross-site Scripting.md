# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Its Techniques

## Introduction

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability commonly associated with web-based applications. It involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by the victim's browser. This can lead to the theft of sensitive information, such as session IDs or credentials. XSS is a critical concern in web development, and understanding its techniques is essential for preventing exploitation.

## Types of XSS Attacks

- **Non-Persistent (Reflected) XSS Attack:**
	- Occurs when a user clicks a specially crafted link, often sent via email.
	- Scripts run within user input fields on a vulnerable website, sending output or payload to the attacker.
	- Information like session IDs or user credentials may be targeted.

- **Persistent (Stored) XSS Attack:**
	- Malicious scripts are permanently stored on a server, embedded in messages or forum posts.
	- Every visitor to the page runs the script, making it potentially widespread.
	- Commonly found in websites with user-generated content, such as forums or message boards.

## Practical Example: Subaru Website Vulnerability

- **Discovery by Aaron Guzman (June 2017):**
	- Authenticated users on the Subaru website received a non-expiring authentication token.
	- The token provided access to service requests and account details related to Subaru vehicles.
	- A cross-site scripting vulnerability in an input field allowed attackers to steal tokens and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

- **Attack Scenario:**
	- An attacker could exploit the XSS vulnerability to add their email address to a victim's Subaru account.
	- This would grant the attacker full access to online features associated with the victim's Subaru vehicle.

## Mitigation and Best Practices

- **User Awareness:**
	- Avoid clicking links in emails; instead, manually navigate to the website.
	- Consider disabling JavaScript or using browser extensions to manage JavaScript execution.

- **Developer Practices:**
	- Implement proper input validation in web applications to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
	- Regularly update and patch web applications to address known security issues.
	- Keep browsers up-to-date to benefit from security enhancements.

XSS remains a significant threat, emphasizing the importance of user education, secure development practices, and continuous efforts to stay informed about emerging vulnerabilities.
