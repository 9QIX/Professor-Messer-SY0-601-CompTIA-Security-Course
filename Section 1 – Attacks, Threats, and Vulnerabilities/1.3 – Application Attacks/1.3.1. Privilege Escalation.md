# Privilege Escalation and Vulnerability Patching

## Introduction

While the focus often centers on preventing attackers from gaining administrative or root-level access to a system, privilege escalation threats involve exploiting vulnerabilities or design flaws to elevate a normal user's rights. It is crucial to address and patch such vulnerabilities promptly to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security of the operating system.

## Types of Privilege Escalation

- **Vertical Privilege Escalation:**
	- Involves a user gaining higher-level access, often administrative or root privileges.
	- Patches and timely updates are crucial to prevent any user from acquiring full system access.

- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:**
	- Occurs when a user gains access to resources typically restricted to another user of the same level.
	- Not limited to administrative or root accounts, making it essential to mitigate these vulnerabilities promptly.

## Safeguards and Mitigations

- **Patch Management:**
	- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities are usually prioritized for quick patching.
	- Antivirus and anti-malware software often detect and prevent exploitation attempts.

- **Data Execution Prevention (DEP):**
	- DEP restricts applications to run only in designated memory areas, blocking attempts to execute from the data section of memory.
	- Operating systems may employ memory randomization to thwart attackers from duplicating exploits across different systems.

- **Memory Randomization:** 
	- Many operating systems randomize memory storage locations, making it challenging for attackers to duplicate exploits across different systems. ## Practical Example: CBE 2020-1530

## Practical Example: CBE 2020-1530

- **Vulnerability Overview:**
	- Title: Windows Remote Access Elevation of Privileged Vulnerability (CBE 2020-1530).
	- Released in August 2020, affecting Microsoft Windows and the Windows Remote Access application.
	- Applicable to various operating systems including Server 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.

- **Scope and Impact:**
	- Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute a single program and gain elevated access on the victim's system.
	- The wide-ranging impact across multiple operating systems highlights the importance of maintaining up-to-date security patches.

## Conclusion

Privilege escalation vulnerabilities pose significant risks, emphasizing the need for vigilant patch management and awareness of potential exploits. Timely updates, DEP, and randomized memory allocation contribute to safeguarding systems from unauthorized access. Continuous efforts to stay up-to-date with the latest security patches remain crucial in mitigating the impact of privilege escalation threats.
