# Evading Traditional Security Measures: Drivers, Shims, and Refactoring

## Introduction
- Anti-virus and anti-malware software are effective against known vulnerabilities with signature-based detection.
- Attackers, seeking new methods, exploit zero-day attacks with unknown vulnerabilities and explore innovative attack types.

## Driver Exploitation
- Drivers act as a conduit between hardware and software, making them a potential target for malware attacks.
- **Example:** In May 2016, audio drivers on Hewlett-Packard systems had a debugging feature with a keylogger, exposing sensitive keystrokes.

## Shims and Windows Compatibility Mode
- Shims fill gaps between objects, and Windows uses compatibility mode shims to run applications as if in a different OS version.
- This utilizes an application compatibility shim cache to transfer information between the existing and previous operating systems.

## Malicious Use of Shims
- Malware authors leverage shims to inject malware into a computer, circumventing security features like user account control in Windows.
- **Example:** In January 2015, attackers exploited a vulnerability in Windows compatibility mode to elevate user privileges.

## Refactoring and Metamorphic Malware
- Refactoring, or metamorphic malware, involves downloading a unique version that evades traditional signatures.
- Additional code, such as a no-op instruction, loops, or pointless code strings, alters the malware's appearance.
- This requires layered security approaches beyond signature-based detection to identify and stop refactored malware.
