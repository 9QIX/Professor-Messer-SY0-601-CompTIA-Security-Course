# Evading Traditional Security Measures

## Introduction
- While antivirus and anti-malware software are effective against known vulnerabilities with existing signatures, attackers seek ways to exploit unknown vulnerabilities and employ new attack types.
- Zero-day attacks, unknown and unpatched vulnerabilities, are particularly attractive to attackers as they lack signatures.
- Drivers, which act as a conduit between hardware and software, can be exploited by attackers to compromise systems.
- An example is the 2016 Hewlett-Packard audio driver vulnerability, where a debugging feature included a keylogger, allowing attackers to capture keystrokes.

## Shimming Vulnerabilities
- Shims are components that fill gaps between two objects or systems.
- Operating systems, like Windows, use compatibility mode shims to run applications as if they are in a different OS version.
- Malware authors can exploit the shim cache, as demonstrated in a 2015 case where the Windows compatibility mode was used to elevate user privileges.

## Refactoring (Metamorphic Malware)
- Refactoring involves modifying malware code to create unique versions, evading traditional signature-based detection.
- Malware authors add no-op instructions, loops, or reorder code to create distinct executable files.
- Traditional antivirus solutions struggle to detect refactored malware due to constantly changing signatures.
- Layered security approaches are needed to identify and prevent refactored malware effectively.
