# Summary: SSL Stripping Attack and Protocol Evolution

## Introduction
Attackers exploit the SSL stripping or HTTP downgrade attack to manipulate the communication between a client and a server, exposing encrypted data. By sitting in the middle of the communication path, attackers can modify the flow, necessitating upgrades and maintenance of software on both client and server workstations to prevent this attack.

## SSL/TLS Evolution
- **SSL Versions:**
    - SSL 2.0 (1995) deprecated in 2011.
    - SSL 3.0 (1996) deprecated in June 2015 due to cryptographic vulnerabilities.
- **Transition to TLS:**
    - Transport Layer Security (TLS) introduced, starting with TLS 1.0 in 1999.
    - TLS 1.1 (2006) deprecated in January 2020.
    - TLS 1.2 and 1.3 (latest standards) commonly used in 2020.

## SSL Stripping Attack
- **Attack Scenario:**
    - Attacker sits on the communication path, often achieved through proxy server, ARP spoofing, or rogue Wi-Fi hotspot.
    - Modifies encrypted communication between client and server, making it vulnerable to interception.
- **Process:**
    1. Client sends HTTP URL to the web server.
    2. Attacker intercepts and relays the request to the web server.
    3. Web server suggests HTTPS; attacker intercepts and replies with an HTTPS request.
    4. Encrypted channel established between attacker and web server, but not between attacker and client.
    5. Attacker decrypts and relays encrypted data in the clear (HTTP) to the client.
    6. Attacker can view and modify exchanged data, including sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

## Countermeasures
- **Configuration:**
    - Configure web browsers to avoid HTTP communication.
    - Configure web servers to reject HTTP and expect direct HTTPS from the website visitor, preventing attackers in the middle.
