# Network Attacks: Replay and Session Hijacking

## Overview

Crafty hackers aim to exploit network traffic to gather sensitive information, such as session IDs or login credentials, to use it against users. This information interception is often done through various methods, including physical access, logical redirection (e.g., ARP poisoning), or malware on a victim's computer.

## Replay Attack

A replay attack involves capturing information during communication and later replaying it to mimic the original user. Pass the hash is a simple form of replay attack, where an attacker intercepts and reuses hashed passwords sent during authentication.

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Encryption:**
	- Employ encrypted channels (SSL/TLS) to protect data during transmission.
2. **Hash Salting:**
	- Use hash salting, associating hashes with unique session IDs to prevent reuse.

## Session Hijacking (Sidejacking)

Session hijacking occurs when an attacker gains access to session IDs, allowing them to impersonate a user. The attacker may capture session IDs from network flows or exploit vulnerabilities to obtain this information.

### Attack Process:
1. **Capture Session Information:**
	- Gather session IDs from network traffic or exploit server vulnerabilities.
2. **Modify Headers:**
	- Change headers to include the captured session ID.
3. **Impersonation:**
	- Pose as the victim, communicating with the service without authentication.

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Encrypted Communication:**
	- Ensure all communication is encrypted to prevent interception of session IDs.
2. **Browser Security:**
	- Regularly check and secure browser cookies to avoid storing sensitive information.
3. **HTTPS/TLS:**
	- Use encrypted protocols for communication to protect session IDs from interception.

Implementing these strategies helps safeguard against replay attacks and session hijacking, maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of network communications.
