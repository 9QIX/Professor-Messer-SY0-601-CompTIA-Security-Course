# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Overview
- In CSRF, attackers leverage a user's trusted browser to perform unauthorized actions on a target site.
- Often referred to as a "sea surf," CSRF takes advantage of the trust a website has for a user's logged-in browser session.
- Anti-forgery techniques, such as cryptographic tokens, should be implemented by web developers to mitigate CSRF attacks.

### Attack Process
1. Attacker creates a request, typically a hyperlink in an email.
2. User, already logged into a target site, clicks on the link.
3. The request is sent to the target site, using the user's credentials.
4. Unauthorized actions, like fund transfers, are performed on the user's behalf.

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### Overview
- SSRF occurs when an attacker induces a vulnerable web application server to perform requests on their behalf.
- The attacker exploits the server's ability to make requests to access services that would normally be unavailable.

### Attack Process
1. Attacker sends a specially crafted request to a vulnerable web application.
2. The web server, acting on behalf of the attacker, performs the request.
3. The attacker gains access to services, possibly within a private network.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Web developers should ensure input validation on the server side and evaluate both input and output to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SSRF attacks.

## Case Example: Capital One (2019)
- An SSRF attack on Capital One's misconfigured WAF led to unauthorized access to an Amazon S3 bucket.
- The attacker obtained security credentials from the WAF, accessed S3 buckets, and stole sensitive information.

CSRF and SSRF attacks highlight the importance of implementing secure coding practices and regularly testing web applications for vulnerabilities.
