# The Cost and Impact of Vulnerabilities

## Introduction
- In February 2018, the United States Council of Economic Advisors released a report titled "The Cost of Malicious Cyber Activity to the US Economy," revealing a financial impact ranging from $57 to $109 billion in 2016. The consequences of vulnerabilities extend beyond finances, motivating the security community to prioritize robust system safety.

## Data Loss Consequences
- **Meow Attack - July 2020:**
	- Example of databases with no passwords or default passwords being vulnerable.
	- Thousands of databases were deleted, replacing data with the word "meow," underscoring the importance of proper database security.
	- Emphasizes the need for regular backups and secure database practices.

- **Identity Theft at Equifax - May to July 2017:**
	- Attackers exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts to access Equifax's database.
	- Information of over 147.9 million Americans and millions of others was compromised, leading to identity theft.
	- CIO and CIS faced consequences, and Equifax paid over half a billion dollars in fines.

## Financial Loss Due to Vulnerabilities
- **Bank of Bangladesh - March 2016:**
	- Exploitation of a SWIFT network vulnerability resulted in attackers attempting to transfer nearly $1 billion.
	- $81 million was laundered through the Filipino Casino industry.
	- Similar vulnerabilities affected other banks globally, highlighting financial risks associated with vulnerabilities.

## Reputation Impact
- **Uber's Data Breach - October 2016:**
	- Uber suffered a breach compromising 25.6 million customer records.
	- Instead of immediate disclosure, Uber paid $100,000 to the hackers, impacting the company's reputation.
	- Disclosures in 2017 led to a $148 million fine, and legal actions against involved parties affected Uber's reputation.

## Uptime and Availability Concerns
- **Ransomware Attack on Banco Estado - September 2021:**
	- Banco Estado, Chile's largest bank, faced a ransomware attack causing internal systems outage.
	- Segmented networks prevented a complete shutdown, but the bank had to delete and restore from backups.
	- Extended downtime emphasized the disruptive impact of vulnerabilities on availability.

In conclusion, vulnerabilities pose multifaceted risks, from financial losses and data breaches to reputation damage and operational disruptions. Addressing these concerns requires a comprehensive approach to security to safeguard systems, data, and overall organizational well-being.
