# RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) and NFC (Near Field Communication)

## RFID Overview
- **Definition:**
	- RFID stands for Radio-Frequency Identification.
	- Commonly used in access cards, assembly lines, pet tracking, and various tracking applications.
- **Technology:**
	- RFID tags can be as small as a grain of rice.
	- Passive tags use radar technology and are powered by the reader's signal.
	- Unidirectional and bidirectional communication options.

## RFID Vulnerabilities
- **Wireless Communication:**
	- Vulnerable to data capture, especially if communication is unencrypted.
	- Active tags may be susceptible to spoofing, allowing unauthorized modification.
	- Potential for denial-of-service attacks by jamming RFID frequencies.
	- Encryption keys may be compromised, undermining security.

## NFC (Near Field Communication)
- **Definition:**
	- NFC is a type of RFID technology with a focus on short-range communication.
	- Commonly used for mobile payments, smart devices, and simplified Bluetooth pairing.

## NFC Security Concerns
- **Similarities with RFID:**
	- Information capture risk, especially if NFC communication lacks encryption.
	- Denial-of-service threats through interference with NFC frequencies.
	- Man-in-the-middle attacks if communication is not properly secured.
	- Authentication is crucial to prevent unauthorized NFC transactions.

## Applications
- **Mobile Devices:**
	- NFC widely used in mobile devices for payments and Bluetooth pairing.
	- Can serve as an authentication factor or a key for unlocking doors.

## Conclusion
- **Security Measures:**
	- Encryption of RFID and NFC communication is essential.
	- Vigilance against data capture, interference, and authentication issues.
	- Awareness of potential vulnerabilities in both RFID and NFC implementations.
