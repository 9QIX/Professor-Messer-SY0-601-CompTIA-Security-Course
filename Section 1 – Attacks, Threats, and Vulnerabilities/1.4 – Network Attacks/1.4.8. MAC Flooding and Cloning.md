# MAC Addresses and Switch Operations

## Introduction
In networking, a MAC address (Media Access Control) serves as the unique identifier for a network card, often referred to as the physical address. Ethernet MAC addresses consist of 48 bits, equivalent to 6 bytes, presented in hexadecimal notation. Understanding MAC addresses is crucial for the proper functioning of switches and local area networks (LANs).

## Switch Operation and MAC Address Tables
- **MAC Address Structure:**
    - 48 bits, divided into the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and the serial number.
    - OUI represents the manufacturer, ensuring the uniqueness of the first three bytes.
- **Switches and Frame Forwarding:**
    - Switches operate at the MAC address level, forwarding or dropping frames based on MAC addresses.
    - Maintain an internal MAC address table to determine frame destinations within the local network.

## Maintaining MAC Address Tables
- **Example Scenario:**
    - Two devices, Sam and the SGC server, connected via a switch.
    - Switch's MAC address table initially empty.
- **Sam to SGC Server Communication:**
    - Sam (MAC: 1000 all 1s) sends a frame to the SGC server (MAC: 1000 all 5s).
    - Switch notes the source MAC (Sam) and the corresponding interface (F0/1) in its MAC table.
- **SGC Server to Sam Communication:**
    - SGC server sends a frame to Sam.
    - Switch checks its MAC table, identifies the destination MAC (Sam), and forwards the frame to F0/1.
    - SGC server's MAC address is added to the switch's MAC table.

## MAC Flooding and Switch Behavior
- **MAC Address Table Limitations:**
    - Switches have a maximum capacity for MAC addresses in their tables.
    - Attackers exploit this limitation by flooding the switch with frames containing different source MAC addresses.
- **Switch Transformation to Hub:**
    - Switch, unable to accommodate new MAC addresses, starts sending frames to all interfaces.
    - Switch essentially transforms into a hub, lacking intelligent frame forwarding.
- **Opportunity for Attackers:**
    - Attackers can collect network traffic by intercepting frames sent to all devices on the switch.

## Protection Against MAC Flooding
- **Flood Guard Feature:**
    - Most switches include a flood guard or similar feature.
    - Restricts an interface from flooding the network with multiple MAC addresses.
- **Preventing MAC Address Spoofing:**
    - Attackers may spoof or clone MAC addresses to gain unauthorized access.
    - Switches often include features to detect and block MAC address cloning or spoofing.

## Conclusion
Understanding MAC addresses and switch operations is fundamental for efficient network communication. MAC address tables enable switches to intelligently forward frames to their destinations within the local network. Awareness of potential threats, such as MAC flooding and address spoofing, allows network administrators to implement protective measures and maintain the integrity and security of the network.
