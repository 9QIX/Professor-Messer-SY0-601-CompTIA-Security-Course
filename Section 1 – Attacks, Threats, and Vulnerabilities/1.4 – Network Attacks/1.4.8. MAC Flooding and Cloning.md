# Understanding MAC Addresses and Switch Operation

## Introduction
In networking, the term MAC address refers to the Media Access Control address of a network card, often called the physical address. In Ethernet, the MAC address is 48 bits or 6 bytes long, written in hexadecimal.

## MAC Address Structure
- The 6 bytes consist of the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and the serial number.
- OUI represents the manufacturer, and the serial number is unique to each network interface card produced by that manufacturer.

## Switch Operation
- Switches operate at the MAC address level, forwarding or dropping traffic based on MAC addresses.
- A switch maintains a MAC address table to associate addresses with specific interfaces.
- Operational requirement: Maintain a loop-free environment, often achieved through Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).

## MAC Address Table Maintenance
- Switches populate their MAC address table as they receive traffic.
- Example: Sam (MAC: 1000 all 1s) communicates with the SGC server (MAC: 1000 all 5s).
- Switch learns and associates Sam's MAC address with the F0/1 interface.
- The MAC address table guides the switch in forwarding frames to the correct destination.

## MAC Address Table Limitations
- Switches have a maximum capacity for MAC addresses in their table.
- Attackers may exploit this by flooding the switch with frames containing new source MAC addresses.
- When the table reaches capacity, the switch enters flood mode, forwarding frames to all interfaces.

## MAC Flooding Protection
- Most switches have flood guard or similar features to prevent MAC flooding.
- Flood guard restricts an interface from sending multiple MAC addresses, protecting against flooding attacks.

## MAC Address Spoofing or Cloning
- Attackers may spoof or clone MAC addresses to gain unauthorized access or create denial-of-service situations.
- Spoofing involves modifying the MAC address of an attacker's device to match a legitimate device.
- Spoofing may be used to bypass MAC address filters in wireless access points or cause confusion in switch MAC tables.
- Some switches include features to detect and block MAC address cloning or spoofing to enhance security.
