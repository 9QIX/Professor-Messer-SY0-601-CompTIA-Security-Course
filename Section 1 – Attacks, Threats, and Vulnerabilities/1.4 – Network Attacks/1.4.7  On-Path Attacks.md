# On-Path Attacks and ARP Poisoning

## Introduction
An on-path attack occurs when an attacker positions themselves between two stations, intercepting and potentially modifying the information being exchanged on the network. Commonly referred to as a "man-in-the-middle" attack, this type of attack allows the interceptor to read and alter the data passing between the two devices without their knowledge.

## ARP Poisoning as an On-Path Attack
- **Definition:**
	- ARP Poisoning (Address Resolution Protocol) is a common on-path attack on a local IP subnet.
	- ARP lacks security measures, enabling attackers to send unsolicited ARP responses and manipulate ARP tables without authentication.
- **Normal ARP Process:**
	- ARP involves devices querying for the MAC address corresponding to an IP address on the local subnet.
	- Devices store obtained MAC addresses in a local ARP cache for future reference.
- **ARP Poisoning Process:**
	- Attacker, with an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.14) and MAC address, sends unsolicited ARP responses to victim device.
	- Victim device accepts the ARP response, updating its ARP cache with the attacker's MAC address.
	- Subsequent traffic to the router (192.168.1.1) from the victim is now sent to the attacker's MAC address.
	- Similar ARP poisoning is performed on the router, completing the on-path attack.
	- All traffic between victim and router is now relayed through the attacker's device.

## Challenges in Executing On-Path Attacks
- **ARP Poisoning Limitations:**
	- Requires the attacker to be on the local network.
	- Accessibility to the local network is not always guaranteed for an attacker.
- **Browser-Based On-Path Attacks:**
	- A more sophisticated on-path attack involves malware residing on the victim's machine.
	- The malware acts as a relay between the victim and other devices, intercepting and manipulating data.
	- On the same computer as the victim, the malware can exploit data in its raw, unencrypted form.

## On-Path Browser Attacks
- **Malware Presence:**
	- Malware resides on the victim's machine, acting as an automated process within the browser.
	- Advantages include access to unencrypted data on the victim's machine.
	- Operates in the background, capturing login credentials, keystrokes, and sensitive information.
- **Security Measures:**
	- Keeping antivirus and anti-malware software up-to-date is crucial to detect and prevent on-path browser attacks.

## Conclusion
On-path attacks, such as ARP poisoning and browser-based attacks, highlight the importance of securing local networks and maintaining vigilant cybersecurity practices. ARP poisoning exploits vulnerabilities in ARP, emphasizing the need for improved security measures in network protocols.
