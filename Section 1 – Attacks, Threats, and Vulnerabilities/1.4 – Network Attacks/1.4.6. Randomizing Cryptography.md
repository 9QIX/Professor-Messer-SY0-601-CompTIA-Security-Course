# Cryptographic Randomization: Nonces and Initialization Vectors

## Introduction
One fundamental aspect of cryptography is the incorporation of sufficient randomization to ensure that encrypted data bears no resemblance to the original plaintext. Without randomization, encryption methods may become susceptible to reverse engineering. This issue is demonstrated through an example using 128-bit ECB (Electronic Code Book) encryption on an image of a puppy, which lacks randomization, resulting in a non-random encrypted form.

## Nonce in Cryptography
- **Definition:**
	- A nonce (for the nonce, meaning for the time being) is an arbitrary number used only once.
	- Introduces randomness to cryptographic processes.
- **Use in Login Process:**
	- Often employed during login to prevent replay attacks.
	- The server sends a random nonce to the client, and the combined hash with the password is sent back for authentication.
	- Ensures the hash is different each time, preventing replay attacks.

## Initialization Vector (IV)
- **Definition:**
	- An IV is a type of nonce used in encryption.
	- Adds randomization to encryption keys, enhancing overall security.
- **Applications:**
	- Commonly used in encryption methods like WEP and some SSL implementations.
	- Strengthens encryption, especially when using the same key repeatedly.

## Password Salt as a Nonce
- **Salt Definition:**
	- A salt is a nonce used in password hashing.
	- A random value unique to each user, ensuring password hash randomness.
- **Purpose:**
	- Mitigates the risk of attackers identifying common passwords by introducing variability.
	- Even if users have identical passwords, the stored hash values appear random.

## Conclusion
- **Importance of Randomization:**
	- Cryptographic nonces, including nonces during logins and salts in password hashing, are crucial for introducing randomness.
	- Nonces prevent predictability and enhance security, particularly in encryption and authentication processes.
