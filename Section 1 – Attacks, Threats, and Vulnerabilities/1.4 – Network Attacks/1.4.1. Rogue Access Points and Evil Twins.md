# Rogue Access Points and Wireless Security

## Introduction
A rogue access point poses a security threat when added to a network without authorization. It can be introduced by end-users or employees, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the corporate network. The increasing ease of creating rogue access points raises concerns about network security.

## Types of Rogue Access Points

1. **Unauthorized Access Points:**
    - Added without proper authorization, often by employees or end-users.
    - May not be malicious, but can become a significant security issue if exploited by attackers.

2. **Creation of Rogue Access Points:**
    - Easy to set up with purchased access points or by enabling wireless sharing on devices.
    - Periodic reviews of the wireless environment are essential to identify and eliminate rogue access points.

3. **Wireless Evil Twin:**
    - Malicious access point designed to mimic legitimate network access points.
    - May use similar SSID names and configurations to trick users into connecting.
    - Can overpower other access points, posing a serious security risk, especially in public Wi-Fi hotspots.

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Network Access Control (NAC):**
    - Implement mechanisms like 802.1x, requiring user authentication before network access.
    - Enhances security by preventing unauthorized access even if a rogue access point is present.

2. **Encryption Practices:**
    - Ensure all communications over wireless networks, especially public Wi-Fi, are encrypted.
    - Encourage the use of HTTPS for website communication or deploy VPN clients for end-to-end encryption.

## Conclusion
Addressing the threat of rogue access points requires a proactive approach, including regular network reviews, robust access controls, and encryption practices. Organizations should prioritize wireless security measures to prevent unauthorized access and potential malicious activities.
