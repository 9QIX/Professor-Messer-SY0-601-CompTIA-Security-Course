# Wireless Disassociation and Deauthentication Attacks

## Wireless Disassociation and Deauthentication Attacks
- **Scenario:**
	- Sudden loss of wireless connectivity, repeated disconnections, and reconnections.

- **Attack Type:**
	- Wireless disassociation or deauthentication attacks.
	- Denial of service attacks causing devices to lose communication with the access point.

- **Attack Mechanism:**
	- Exploits the lack of protection for management frames in the original 802.11 standard.
	- Management frames are sent in the clear, allowing attackers to disrupt communication.

- **Management Frames:**
	- Includes association requests, disassociation, deauthentication, and other critical functions.
	- Original 802.11 standard lacked authentication or verification for these frames.

- **Vulnerability Mitigation:**
	- IEEE addressed the issue with the 802.11w update in July 2014.
	- The update encrypts critical management frames, protecting against deauthentication attacks.
	- Frames like beacons, probes, authentication, and association remain unencrypted for initial connections.

- **IEEE Update:**
	- The 802.11w update integrated into the 802.11ac standard and later versions.
	- Networks using 802.11ac or newer standards are protected against deauthentication attacks.

- **Note:**
	- Protection against deauthentication attacks ensures more secure and stable wireless network connections.
