# Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing

## Bluejacking
- **Definition:**
	- Attacker sends unsolicited messages to a victim's mobile device over Bluetooth.
	- Operates within a radius of about 10 meters.
	- Exclusive to Bluetooth communication, not using cellular frequencies or 802.11 networks.

- **Characteristics:**
	- Low-priority security concern.
	- Messages are typically harmless and do not provide enhanced capabilities.
	- Some Bluetooth implementations allow additional content, such as contact cards or media, to be sent along with the message.

- **Security Measures:**
	- User training to handle unsolicited messages.
	- Relatively low risk compared to other security threats.

## Bluesnarfing
- **Definition:**
	- Attacker accesses data on a mobile device using the Bluetooth channel.
	- Can retrieve contact lists, emails, calendar information, and other data stored on the device.

- **Historical Context:**
	- Emerged as a significant security concern in 2003.
	- Promptly patched in modern devices, making them immune to Bluesnarfing.

- **Security Measures:**
	- Not a concern for modern devices with updated security patches.
	- Older devices may be susceptible, requiring proper security configurations to mitigate the risk.
