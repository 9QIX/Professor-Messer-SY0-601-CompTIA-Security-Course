# DNS Manipulation and Associated Attacks

## Introduction
Attackers often manipulate DNS (Domain Name System) to redirect traffic to malicious websites. DNS poisoning is a sophisticated attack that can be executed in various ways, allowing attackers to control the resolution of domain names to IP addresses.

## Methods of DNS Poisoning
1. **Host File Modification:**
    - Attackers may modify the host file on individual devices, giving the altered file precedence over DNS queries.
    - The host file dictates the IP address associated with domain names, bypassing DNS configurations.

2. **On-Path Attack:**
    - Involves an attacker intercepting and modifying DNS queries during transmission.
    - Enables the attacker to change the resolved IP address to redirect users to a malicious site.

3. **Legitimate DNS Server Modification:**
    - Attackers may directly modify DNS information on a legitimate DNS server.
    - Alters the IP addresses associated with domain names, affecting all queries handled by that DNS server.

## Scenario of DNS Poisoning
Consider the following scenario:
- Legitimate DNS server has IP for `professormesser.com` as 162.159.246.164.
- Attacker aims to redirect it to 100.100.100.100.

   - **User 1's DNS Query:**
        - User 1 queries DNS for `professormesser.com`.
        - Legitimate DNS server responds with IP 162.159.246.164.
        - User 1 caches this information locally.

   - **Attacker's DNS Modification:**
        - Attacker gains access to DNS server, changes IP for `professormesser.com` to 100.100.100.100.

   - **User 2's Subsequent Query:**
        - User 2 queries the same DNS server for `professormesser.com`.
        - DNS server, now poisoned, responds with the incorrect IP 100.100.100.100.
        - User 2 is redirected to the attacker's website.

   - **Duration of Control:**
        - The attacker maintains control for a specific period, redirecting all DNS queries to the malicious IP.

## Other DNS-Related Attacks
1. **DNS Hijacking/Domain Configuration Modification:**
    - Attackers gain access to domain registrar accounts to modify DNS configurations.
    - Achieved through password brute-forcing, social engineering, or compromising associated email accounts.

2. **URL Hijacking:**
    - Creation of domains similar to legitimate ones to redirect users to malicious sites or display ads.
    - Offers opportunities for phishing or selling misleading domain names.
	    - Types of URL hijacking:
		    - Typosquatting/brandjacking
		    - Outright misspelling
		    - A typing error
		    - A different phrase
		    - Different domain

3. **Domain Reputation/Reputation Management Challenges:**
    - Organizations face reputation issues if their email or web servers are compromised.
    - Email reputation can suffer if users mark emails as spam, limiting the ability to send legitimate emails.

4. **Malware on Web Servers:**
    - Web servers infected with malware can be indexed by search engines, leading to warnings for visitors.
    - Damage to brand reputation occurs, and removal of warnings requires time for re-indexing.

## Mitigating DNS-Related Threats
1. **Regular Reputation Monitoring:**
    - Constantly monitor the reputation of email and web servers.
    - Identify and address issues promptly to prevent long-term damage.

2. **DNS Security Measures:**
    - Implement DNS security features to detect and prevent unauthorized modifications.
    - Use DNS monitoring tools to identify unusual activity and potential poisoning attempts.

3. **User Education:**
    - Raise awareness about URL hijacking and phishing attempts.
    - Encourage users to report suspicious emails or websites.

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    - Strengthen domain registrar and DNS server access with MFA.
    - Enhances security against unauthorized changes.

## Conclusion
DNS manipulation poses serious threats, from redirecting traffic to damaging an organization's reputation. Understanding the methods employed by attackers and implementing robust security measures are crucial for maintaining the integrity of DNS infrastructure and ensuring a secure online environment.
