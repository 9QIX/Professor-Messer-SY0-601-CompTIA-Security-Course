# Radio Frequency Jamming in Wireless Networks

## Overview
- **Definition:**
	- Radio frequency jamming (RF jamming) disrupts wireless networks, causing a denial of service.
	- Objective: Decrease signal-to-noise ratio at the receiving device (end station or access point).

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio:**
	- Describes the relationship between the good signal and other wireless signals.
	- Effective communication requires the good signal to overcome noise.

## Jamming Techniques
- **Intentional and Unintentional Disruption:**
	- Microwave ovens or unintentional interference can disrupt signals.
	- Malicious attacks involve intentionally generating noise to overwhelm wireless signals.

- **Attack Strategies:**
	- Continuous transmission of random data or legitimate frames to consume bandwidth.
	- Intermittent jamming with random or legitimate frames to disrupt normal communication.
	- Targeted jamming, selectively sending signals when devices attempt to communicate.

## Proximity and Detection
- **Physical Proximity:**
	- Jamming device needs to be close to the wireless network for effective disruption.

- **Detection Challenges:**
	- Locating the source of jamming signals can be challenging.
	- Fox hunting involves using directional antennas to identify signal sources.

## Mitigation and Resolution
- **Challenges:**
	- Identifying and resolving jamming issues can be complex.
	- Requires appropriate equipment and techniques for detection.

- **Countermeasures:**
	- Implementing RF shielding.
	- Using spectrum analyzers for detection.
	- Conducting fox hunts to locate signal sources.

- **Conclusion:**
	- Resolving jamming issues is crucial for maintaining reliable wireless communication.
	- Adequate equipment and techniques are essential for effective detection and removal.
