# Penetration Tests in IT Security

## Introduction

Penetration tests in IT security involve actively attempting to gain access to systems, simulating exploits and attacks similar to those conducted by external attackers. This goes beyond vulnerability scanning, as penetration tests focus on exploiting identified vulnerabilities to assess the system's resilience to unauthorized access. Mandated by rules or regulations, organizations often contract third parties to perform regular penetration tests.

## Rules of Engagement

- **Invasiveness and Scope:**

  - Rules of engagement define the purpose and scope of penetration tests.
  - Clear guidelines on systems considered, testing perspective (internal or external), and timing are established.

- **IP Addresses and Contacts:**
  - Lists of in-scope and out-of-scope IP addresses are provided.
  - Emergency contacts are specified for unforeseen situations during tests.

## Sensitivity and Information Exposure

- **Sensitive Information Handling:**
  - Penetration tests may uncover sensitive information during vulnerability exploits.
  - Information exposure considerations depend on the test type, whether unknown, known, or a mix of environments.

## Penetration Test Execution

- **Permission and System Impact:**

  - Testers must have explicit permission to exploit vulnerabilities.
  - Potential impacts, such as denial of service or system crashes, necessitate a recovery process.

- **Diverse Exploitation Techniques:**
  - Penetration tests employ various techniques like password brute-force, social engineering, database injections, and buffer overflows.
  - Identifying multiple ways to gain access ensures comprehensive testing.

## Lateral Movement and Persistence

- **Lateral Movement:**

  - After initial access, lateral movement within the network is crucial.
  - Security on the inside is often less stringent, making lateral movement easier for attackers.

- **Persistence Establishment:**
  - Creating backdoors, reconfiguring accounts, and configuring default passwords ensure access even after vulnerabilities are fixed.
  - A pivot point may serve as a central hub for further exploitation.

## Post-Test Reversion

- **System Reversion:**
  - Systems modified during the test must be reverted to their original state.
  - Network reconfigurations, added files, backdoors, and created accounts should be removed.

## Bug Bounty Programs

- **Bug Bounty Rewards:**
  - Some individuals make a living through penetration testing, participating in bug bounty programs.
  - Bug bounties, provided by system owners, reward researchers for identifying vulnerabilities and exploits.

In conclusion, penetration tests are essential for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities. A well-executed test, following rules of engagement and best practices, contributes to robust cybersecurity by proactively addressing potential threats.
