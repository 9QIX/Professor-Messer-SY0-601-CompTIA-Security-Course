# Reconnaissance in Penetration Testing

## Introduction

Before initiating a penetration test, conducting reconnaissance is crucial. This phase involves gathering information about the systems that will be targeted, providing insights into security tools, key devices, and the overall network architecture.

## Understanding Security Tools

- Researching existing firewalls and security devices is essential.
- Identifying key devices and focusing efforts on them helps streamline the penetration test.

## Creating a Network Map

- A network map aids in understanding IP address schemes, device locations, and VLAN information.
- It provides a visual representation of the target environment.

## Passive Footprinting

- **Definition:**

  - Passive footprinting involves gathering information without being detected by the target.
  - Utilizes open-source intelligence (OSINT) from social media, corporate websites, online forums, and other public sources.

- **OSINT Framework:**

  - [osintframework.com](https://osintframework.com) provides a comprehensive framework for gathering information.
  - Categories include usernames, email addresses, search engine data, dating sites, archives, and more.

- **Tools for Automation:**
  - Various tools automate data gathering from multiple websites.
  - Passive footprinting tools help in efficiently collecting extensive information.

## Wardriving and Warflying

- **Wardriving:**

  - Combining Wi-Fi analysis with GPS to identify wireless networks.
  - Gathers information on SSIDs, encryption status, signal strength, and more.

- **Warflying:**

  - Similar to wardriving but employs drones for aerial reconnaissance.
  - Provides a broader perspective of wireless networks.

- **Tools and Resources:**
  - Tools like Kismet and inSSIDer assist in wardriving.
  - [wigle.net](https://wigle.net) offers a map overlay of wardriving results.

## Active Footprinting

- **Definition:**

  - Active footprinting involves actively sending information to gather details about the network.
  - Includes ping scans, port scans, DNS analysis, and detailed OS analysis.

- **Tools and Techniques:**
  - Tools like Nmap are used for port scanning and OS version identification.
  - Active footprinting tasks are visible to network monitoring, making stealth important.

In conclusion, reconnaissance is a critical phase in penetration testing, encompassing both passive and active footprinting. Thoroughly understanding the target environment aids in planning and executing effective penetration tests.
