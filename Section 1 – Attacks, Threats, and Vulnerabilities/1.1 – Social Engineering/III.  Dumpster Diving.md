- **Introduction:**
	- When exploring IT security, one may not have envisioned spending time inside a garbage bin, yet Dumpster diving is a valid method for extracting critical information discarded in the trash.
- **Dumpster Diving Concept:**
	- The term originates from the United States, where the receptacle is trademarked as a Dumpster. Other countries may refer to it as a rubbish skip or garbage disposal unit.
- **Information in the Trash:**
	- Personal details often end up in the trash, including monthly statements, business-related information, and communications from associates, friends, and family.
	- Attackers exploit this by waiting for individuals to dispose of their trash and then collecting valuable information.
- **Legalities of Dumpster Diving:**
	- In the United States, Dumpster diving is generally considered legal unless local laws or regulations prohibit it.
	- The legality is often based on the principle that once something is in the garbage, it's considered accessible to anyone nearby.
- **Legal Considerations:**
	- Check for signs like "no trespassing" or other restrictions before attempting Dumpster diving.
	- While generally legal, nuances and legal gray areas exist, and consulting a legal representative is advisable.
- **Preventive Measures:**
	- Secure Your Garbage Area:
		- Lock up and secure the garbage area, especially in large organizations.
		- Consider placing it behind locked gates or fences.
	- Shredding Documents:
		- Cut documents into small pieces to prevent reconstruction.
		- Shredders can automate this process.
	- Incineration:
		- In high-security environments, incineration may be employed to ensure complete destruction.
- **Personal Security Awareness:**
	- Regularly inspect the items you discard to ensure you're not inadvertently providing attackers with personal information.
