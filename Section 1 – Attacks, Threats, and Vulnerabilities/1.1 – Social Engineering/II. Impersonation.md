- **Overview:**
	- Attackers often excel at impersonation, creating scenarios with pretexts and actors to gain access or extract information.
- **Common Elements:**
	- **Pretext:**
		- A fabricated story or lie that sets up the scenario for the attack.
	- **Actor:**
		- Typically the attacker attempting to gain access or extract information.
	- **Story:**
		- A narrative or scenario crafted to manipulate the target.
- **Real-life Examples:**
	1. *Scenario:* Wendy from "Microsoft Windows" makes an urgent check-up call for computer issues.
		- *Objective:* Convince the target to pay for fake technical support or enlist the computer into a botnet.
	2. *Scenario:* Voicemail claims to be an "enforcement action executed by the US Treasury" demanding attention.
		- *Objective:* Pretending to be from a governmental agency, the attacker seeks to extract money.
	3. *Scenario:* Congratulations on a great payment history, offering 0% interest rates on credit card accounts.
		- *Objective:* Encouraging victims to fill out a financial application, unwittingly providing personal details.
- **Impersonation Techniques:**
	- **Targeted Impersonation:**
		- Based on reconnaissance, attackers impersonate someone familiar to the target, using information like names, organizations, and locations.
	- **Role-based Impersonation:**
		- Pretending to hold a higher rank or a specific role within an organization to influence the target's response.
	- **Technical Jargon:**
		- In help desk impersonation, attackers use technical terms to confuse the target and appear authentic.
	- **Friendliness:**
		- Acting friendly and mentioning local events to create a sense of comfort.
- **Eliciting Information:**
	- Once the target is at ease, attackers use psychological methods to extract information.
	- Commonly done through voice phishing (vishing) over the phone.
- **Identity Theft Risks:**
	- Attackers target personal information for identity fraud, leading to issues like credit card fraud, bank account access, loan fraud, government benefit fraud, and tax fraud.
- **Protective Measures:**
	- **Personal Information Protection:**
		- Be cautious and avoid volunteering personal information to unsolicited callers.
		- Passwords are never required for legitimate technical support services.
	- **Verification Process:**
		- Verify the caller's legitimacy by independently checking contact details and calling back directly.
- **Conclusion:**
	- Vigilance and skepticism are crucial in protecting personal information from social engineering attacks. Verification processes should be integrated into communication practices, especially for individuals managing sensitive information.
