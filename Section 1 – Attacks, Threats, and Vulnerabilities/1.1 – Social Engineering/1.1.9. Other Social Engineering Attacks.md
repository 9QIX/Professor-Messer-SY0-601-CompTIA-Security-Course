### Tailgating:
- **Definition:**
	- Unauthorized individuals intentionally following someone through a secured door to gain access without proper credentials.

- **Social Engineering Aspects:**
	- Exploits human tendencies to hold doors open or allow apparent third-party vendors inside.
	- Utilizes blending techniques, such as pretending to be on a break or carrying food, to appear legitimate.

- **Prevention Measures:**
	- Visitor policies with clear identification and accompanying authorized personnel.
	- Signage reminders (e.g., "No Tailgating" or "One Scan, One Person").
	- Access control vestibules or systems allowing only one person through at a time.

### Invoice Scam:
- **Description:**
	- Attackers send fake invoices to targeted individuals responsible for payments within an organization.
	- Invoices often mimic legitimate bills for products or services, appearing convincing.

- **Attack Method:**
	- Spoofed email addresses, possibly from authoritative figures, requesting payment.
	- Fake invoices may include links for online payments, leading to potential financial and credential compromises.

### Credential Harvesting Attack:
- **Objective:**
	- Extract usernames and passwords stored on a local computer, targeting various applications like browsers and email clients.

- **Execution:**
	- Attackers send malicious attachments (e.g., Word documents) containing macros.
	- Macros run scripts on the user's computer, extracting credentials, which are then sent to the attacker.

- **Prevention Measures:**
	- Use antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and block such attacks.
	- Educate users about the risks associated with opening attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.

*Note: Awareness and a combination of technical safeguards are crucial in preventing these social engineering attacks.*
