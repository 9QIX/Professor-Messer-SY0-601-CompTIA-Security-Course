- **Introduction:**
	- The information stored on your computer, including spreadsheets, documents, and presentations, can be crucial for your day-to-day work. Unbeknownst to you, this information might be valuable to others, and one method attackers use to gain access is called shoulder surfing.
- **Shoulder Surfing Defined:**

- **Real-life Example:**
	- *Scenario:* Traveling in airports and airplanes, observing individuals working on sensitive information in the row in front.
		- *Observation:* Sitting directly behind allowed clear visibility of everything on their computer screen.
- **Remote Shoulder Surfing:**
	- In large cities or crowded areas, attackers could employ binoculars or telescopes from a distance, viewing computer screens even from another building.
- **Security Measures:**
	- **Awareness of Surroundings:**
