- **Definition:**
	- Phishing involves deceptive attempts to gather personal information, often via emails pretending to be legitimate entities.

- **Techniques:**
	- **Social Engineering:** Manipulates individuals to reveal sensitive information.
	- **Spoofing:** Fakes the sender's identity, commonly seen in emails.

- **Identification Tips:**
	- Check the email sender's address and ensure it matches the legitimate source.
	- Examine the URL in the address bar for discrepancies.
	- Be cautious of pretexting, where attackers create false scenarios to prompt action.

- **Examples:**
	- **Typosquatting:** Mimics legitimate URLs with slight misspellings.
		- *Scenario:* You intend to visit "bankofamerica.com," but a malicious site uses "bankofamerrica.com" with a slight misspelling. Unsuspecting users might input their credentials, thinking it's the legitimate site.
	- **Prepending:** Adds extra text to the beginning of a domain name.
		- *Scenario:* Instead of the legitimate "professormesser.com," an attacker uses "pprofessormesser.com." Users might not notice the additional text and fall for the phishing attempt.

- **Pharming:**
	- Redirects users to a malicious website by compromising the DNS server.
	- Harvest large groups of people.
	- Difficult to detect as it leads users to seemingly legitimate sites.
		- *Scenario:* Attackers compromise a DNS server, redirecting users trying to access an online banking site to a fraudulent website. Users, thinking they're on the legitimate site, unwittingly provide login credentials.

- **Vishing (Voice Phishing):**
	- Attackers use phone calls, often spoofing local numbers.
	- Aim to extract personal information via voice communication.
		- *Scenario:* A caller, posing as a support representative from your internet provider, informs you of a security breach. They request sensitive information to "verify" your account, using a local number to appear genuine.

- **Smishing (SMS Phishing):**
	- Phishing conducted through text messages (SMS).
	- Typically includes a link to entice users to provide information.
		- *Scenario:* You receive a text message claiming to be from a delivery service, providing a link to track a package. Clicking the link directs you to a fake website asking for personal information under the guise of package details.

- **Reconnaissance for Financial Attacks:**
	- Attackers perform extensive research using open-source information.
	- Pretext is tailored based on the gathered information.
		- *Scenario:* An attacker gathers information from an executive's public profiles, learns about their work habits, associates, and interests. Using this, they craft a convincing email requesting a fund transfer.

- **Spear Phishing:**
	- Targeted phishing attacks on specific individuals or groups.
	- In-depth research for a personalized and convincing approach.
		- *Scenario:* An employee in a finance department receives an email appearing to be from the CEO, urgently requesting a fund transfer for a confidential project. The email is personalized, and due to the urgency, the employee complies.

- **Whaling:**
	- A form of spear phishing targeting high-profile individuals, often in control of significant funds or information.
		- *Scenario:* Cybercriminals target the CEO of a company, sending personalized emails claiming to be urgent business matters. The email convinces the CEO to click on a link, leading to a fake login page capturing executive-level credentials.

- **Mitigation:**
	- Educate users to validate links and be wary of unexpected communications.
	- Implement security measures to detect and prevent phishing attempts.
