- **Introduction:**
	- In a highly secure organization, attackers may face challenges directly infiltrating systems. As a result, they adopt a different strategy by targeting third-party websites, creating a central location known as the "watering hole" to exploit.

- **Watering Hole Defined:**
	- The watering hole is a third-party website attackers infect, anticipating that users from the secure organization will visit, become infected, and subsequently provide a gateway into the organization's network.

- **Attackers' Approach:**
	- Conduct research to identify websites frequented by the organization's users.
	- Examples include infecting local businesses or industrial sites where users are likely to visit.

- **Vulnerability Exploitation:**
	- Attackers focus on exploiting vulnerabilities on the third-party site, aiming to affect a broader audience.
	- The goal is to infect a significant number of visitors, including those from the targeted organization.

- **Real-life Example:**
	- *Scenario:* In January 2017, watering hole attacks targeted sites of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, the National Banking and Stock Commission of Mexico, and a state-owned bank in Uruguay, all with a financial focus.
		- *Observation:* Malicious JavaScript files were downloaded selectively based on specific IP addresses, indicating a targeted approach.

- **Preventing Watering Hole Attacks:**
	- **Layered Defense (Defense in Depth):**
		- Employ a multi-layered defense strategy to ensure comprehensive security.
		- Consider using next-generation firewalls or intrusion prevention systems to identify and block malicious software.

- **Symantec Antivirus Example:**
	- *Scenario:* Symantec's antivirus software detected a generic JavaScript attack signature during the Polish Financial Supervision Authority watering hole attack.
		- *Outcome:* Users running Symantec antivirus were alerted, preventing the execution of the malicious JavaScript and avoiding infection.

- **Conclusion:**
	- Awareness and vigilance are crucial in combating watering hole attacks, whether they occur within the organization's network or on third-party sites.
