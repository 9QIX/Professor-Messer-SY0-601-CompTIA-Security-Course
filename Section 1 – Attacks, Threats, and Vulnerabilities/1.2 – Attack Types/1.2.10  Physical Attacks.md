# Physical Attacks and Credit Card Fraud

## Malicious USB Devices

- **Malicious USB Cable:**
	- Appears normal but contains additional electronics.
	- Mimics a Human Interface Device (HID) to execute commands.
	- Risk: Untrusted cables can inject malware into the system.

- **Malicious Flash Drive:**
	- May appear normal but contains extra electronics.
	- Utilizes HID functionality to run malicious commands.
	- Risk: Plugging in unknown flash drives may lead to malware infection.

	### Additional Risks:
	- Attackers may insert malware in files (e.g., PDFs) on the flash drive.
	- Exploitation of USB boot device configurations during system restart.
	- Possibility of flash drive acting as a wireless interface for attacks.

## Credit Card Skimming

- **Skimming Devices:**
	- Steals credit card information during legitimate card usage.
	- Copies data from magnetic stripe or intercepts information from the system.
	- Attackers add extra hardware to card readers, sometimes with hidden cameras.

	### Prevention:
	- Carefully inspect card readers for any irregularities.
	- Check for additional components added by attackers.
	- Some banks use specially molded or colored plastic to deter skimming.

	### Real-life Example:
	Attackers damaging an ATM system to install a skimming device.

## Credit Card Cloning

- **Online Transactions:**
	- Attackers use skimmed card details for online transactions.
	- May perform online transactions with the stolen information.

- **Cloning Physical Cards:**
	- Attackers create duplicates with the same card details.
	- Magnetic stripe cloning is common; chips cannot be cloned.
	- Cloned cards used in transactions accepting magnetic stripe.

	### Risk Mitigation:
	- Regularly check for any unauthorized transactions on your cards.

	### Note:
	- Magnetic stripe cloning prevalent with gift cards.
	- Attacker clones a gift card, activates it first, and uses it before the legitimate user.

*Note: Vigilance is crucial to avoid physical attacks. Always inspect USB devices and card readers for potential threats. Monitor your credit card transactions for any unauthorized activity.*
