### Viruses:
- **Definition:**
	- Malicious software that can replicate itself but requires user intervention (e.g., clicking or launching an application) to initiate the replication process.

- **Replication Process:**
	- Needs a human to start the process, distinguishing it from worms.
	- Replicates through the file system or network after user initiation.

- **Functions:**
	- Varied impact: from deleting files to benign actions like displaying ads or gathering information.
	- Antivirus software helps detect and prevent virus execution by recognizing signatures.

- **Common Types:**
	1. **Program Virus:**
		- Part of an application, requires launching the application for virus execution.
	2. **Boot Sector Virus:**
		- Resides in the boot sector of storage; executes during system startup.
	3. **Script Virus:**
		- Operates as a script in the OS or browser.
	4. **Macro Virus:**
		- Embedded within applications, often associated with Microsoft Office apps.
	5. **Fileless Virus:**
		- Operates in memory, doesn't save itself as a file; avoids antivirus detection.
		- Executed by clicking links on websites or in emails.

### Worms:
- **Definition:**
	- Self-replicating malware that spreads through networks without user intervention.

- **Characteristics:**
	- Exploits vulnerabilities to move from system to system.
	- Propagates rapidly across connected networks and the internet.

- **Propagation Prevention:**
	- Firewall or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) can block worm propagation if a signature is available.

- **Notable Worm: WannaCry (May 12, 2017):**
	- Exploited SMB v1 vulnerability using EternalBlue.
	- Installed DoublePulsar backdoor and WannaCry ransomware.
	- Automated propagation without human intervention, causing widespread damage.

### Key Points:
- Traditional viruses require user initiation, while worms self-replicate without user intervention.
- Antivirus software detects viruses based on signatures and prevents execution.
- Fileless viruses operate in memory, evading detection by not saving themselves as files.
- Worms exploit vulnerabilities to propagate rapidly across networks.
- Notable example: WannaCry worm caused significant damage by combining self-replication with destructive actions.
