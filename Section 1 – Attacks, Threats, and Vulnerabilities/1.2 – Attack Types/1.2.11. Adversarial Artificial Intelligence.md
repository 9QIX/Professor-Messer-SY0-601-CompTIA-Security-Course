# Machine Learning and the Risks of Poisoned Data

## Overview

Machine learning empowers computers to analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and deliver services based on learned patterns. While this enhances various applications, there are challenges, especially concerning the need for substantial, high-quality data for training. However, the use of malicious or invalid data during training can compromise the integrity of artificial intelligence (AI) models.

## Importance of Legitimate Training Data

- **Training Data Volume:**
	- Face recognition, autonomous vehicles, spam filters, and recommendation systems require extensive datasets for effective training.
	- Millions of faces, diverse driving scenarios, and user interactions contribute to the learning process.

- **Applications of Machine Learning:**
	- Enhanced spam filters, personalized recommendations in online retail, and intelligent features in streaming services.
	- Trained cars capable of recognizing and avoiding potential hazards.

## Risks and Challenges

- **Poisoned Training Data:**
	- Attackers may inject malicious or inappropriate data during the training process.
	- Microsoft's AI chatter bot "Tay" faced issues when users poisoned its learning, leading to offensive behavior.
	- Lack of anti-offensive learning algorithms allowed users to manipulate Tay's responses.

- **Adaptation by Attackers:**
	- Attackers may change tactics post-learning to evade machine learning models.
	- Spam filters susceptible to slight modifications in spam message formatting after initial learning.

- **Data Extraction Post-Learning:**
	- Instances where attackers interacted with trained models to extract sensitive information.
	- Highlighting the risk of exposure of private data even after the initial learning phase.

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Data Legitimacy:**
	- Ensure all data used for training is legitimate to maintain the effectiveness of machine learning models.
	- Regularly assess and validate the quality of training datasets.

- **Periodic Retraining:**
	- Schedule periodic retraining of machine learning models with updated and diverse datasets.
	- Keep models aligned with evolving patterns and potential risks.

- **Security Measures:**
	- Apply security measures during the learning process to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
	- Employ techniques to validate and secure against adversarial attacks.

*Note: Safeguarding the integrity of machine learning models requires ongoing efforts to validate, retrain, and implement security measures against potential adversarial attacks.*
