### Trojan Horses in Computing:
- **Definition:**
	- Digital versions of the ancient Trojan horse used by attackers to deceive users.
	- Pretend to be legitimate software but contain hidden malicious functionalities.

- **Characteristics:**
	- Designed to appear normal to users and evade antivirus detection.
	- Can disable security tools, allowing unrestricted access to the computer.

### Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs):
- **Definition:**
	- Software that may not be explicitly malicious but can cause performance issues or undesirable outcomes.
	- Examples include browser toolbars, ad-supported utilities, and search engine hijackers.

- **Detection:**
	- Anti-malware software identifies and removes PUPs.
	- Examples: Conduit, MyPC Backup, Spigot, Mobo Genie.

### Backdoors in Computing:
- **Definition:**
	- Software or mechanisms that create a secondary entry point to a system, bypassing normal security.
	- Often used by malware to maintain access for future attacks.

- **Use by Multiple Malware:**
	- Once a backdoor is created, various malware types can exploit it for infection.
	- Backdoors can be unintentionally included in software, hardware, or network-connected devices.

### Remote Access Trojans (RATs):
- **Definition:**
	- Remote Access Trojans or Remote Administration Tools provide remote control over a compromised system.
	- Allows attackers nearly complete control, including keystroke logging, screen recording, file transfers, and malware embedding.

- **Example: DarkComet RAT:**
	- Offers a graphical administration frontend for attackers.
	- Enables various functions such as registry configuration, script execution, file transfer, and system restart.

### Prevention Measures:
1. **Safe Computing Practices:**
	- Avoid clicking unknown links or links in suspicious emails.
	- Exercise caution when installing software from untrusted sources.

2. **Antivirus Software:**
	- Ensure antivirus software is running with the latest signatures.
	- Regularly update and scan for potential threats.

3. **Regular Backups:**
	- Maintain offline backups to restore the system in case of an infection.
	- A known-good backup helps recover the system without paying ransom.

### Key Takeaway:
- Trojan horses disguise malicious software as legitimate.
- PUPs, though not explicitly harmful, can cause undesirable effects.
- Backdoors create secondary entry points, exploited by multiple malware.
- RATs provide remote control, compromising system integrity.
- Prevention involves safe practices, updated antivirus software, and regular backups.
