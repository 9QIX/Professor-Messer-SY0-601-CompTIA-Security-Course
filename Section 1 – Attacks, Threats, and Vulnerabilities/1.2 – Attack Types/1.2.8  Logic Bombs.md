# Logic Bombs: Covert Triggers within Systems

## Introduction to Logic Bombs:

- A **logic bomb** is an attack triggered by a separate event, often left by disgruntled employees or individuals with grievances against an organization.
- A common type is the **time bomb**, activated when a specific date and time are reached.

## Varieties of Logic Bombs:

- Events triggering a logic bomb can extend beyond time, such as placing a file in a specific folder or turning a computer on/off.
- Difficult to identify due to the absence of known signatures, making automatic recognition by antivirus or anti-malware challenging.
- Logic bombs may self-delete after execution, complicating post-incident evidence gathering.

   ### Real-life Scenario 1:
   A time-based logic bomb in South Korea (March 19, 2013) targeted media organizations and banks, activating at 2:00 PM local time, deleting master boot records, disrupting workstations, servers, and automatic teller machines.

   ### Real-life Scenario 2:
   A disruptive time bomb in Ukraine (December 17, 2016, at 11:53 PM) focused on high voltage substations, disabling electrical circuits, and bringing down electrical connections throughout the country.

## Prevention and Detection:

- **Formal Processes and Controls:** Establish processes and controls for environment changes to detect unauthorized modifications.
- **Automated Monitoring:** Implement host-based intrusion prevention or tools like **Tripwire** to detect and alert on specific changes.
- **Constant Auditing:** Regularly audit alert systems and computer systems, especially for unauthorized changes.

   ### Real-life Scenario:
   System administrators using auditing processes to ensure all changes are authorized and detect any suspicious activity related to logic bombs.

*Note: The clandestine nature of logic bombs demands proactive prevention through established processes, automated monitoring, and vigilant auditing to mitigate the risk of their installation and activation.*
