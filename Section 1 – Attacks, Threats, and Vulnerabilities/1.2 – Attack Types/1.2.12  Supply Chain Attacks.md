# Supply Chain Security: Vulnerabilities and Lessons Learned

## Overview

The supply chain represents the intricate network involved in the manufacturing process, encompassing raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, and consumers. This interconnected system provides various points of entry for potential attacks, posing significant risks to organizations relying on the integrity of their supply chains.

## Trust in the Supply Chain

- **Chain Complexity:**
	- The complexity of the supply chain, from raw materials to end-users, provides ample opportunities for attackers to compromise any point in the process.
	- Trust in received materials, software, or technology may lead to overlooking potential vulnerabilities introduced earlier in the chain.

- **Attack Points:**
	- Attackers exploit trust in suppliers, introducing malware or vulnerabilities that may manifest in equipment or technology downstream.
	- The trust placed in received goods creates a potential blind spot for organizations, as the source of compromise may not be apparent.

## Target Corporation Breach

- **Incident Overview:**
	- A notable supply chain breach occurred in November 2013 at Target Corporation, where 40 million credit card numbers were stolen.
	- The attack did not originate at Target but began with an HVAC company in Pennsylvania responsible for maintaining Target's HVAC systems.

- **Attack Vector:**
	- Attackers targeted the HVAC supplier, compromising it with malware through an email.
	- By obtaining VPN credentials, the attackers gained access to the Target network, leading to the compromise of over 40 million credit cards.

- **Unconventional Attack Path:**
	- The breach illustrates an unexpected attack vector, showcasing how attackers exploited a seemingly unrelated part of the supply chain to compromise a major corporation.

## Supply Chain Cybersecurity Concerns

- **Security Measures:**
	- Organizations are increasingly concerned about supply chain cybersecurity, realizing the importance of trusting the servers, routers, switches, firewalls, and software they integrate into their networks.
	- Many organizations are reducing the number of vendors to enhance testing and auditing processes, ensuring the trustworthiness of received supplies.

- **Vendor Controls and Audits:**
	- Organizations are implementing strict controls on suppliers and conducting regular audits to verify the security measures within the supplier's network.
	- Collaboration between organizations and suppliers is crucial to maintaining a secure supply chain and delivering safer products to end-users.

## Conclusion

The Target Corporation breach serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the need for vigilance throughout the supply chain. Organizations must actively engage with suppliers, implement stringent controls, and conduct thorough audits to mitigate the risks associated with supply chain vulnerabilities. As supply chain cybersecurity continues to be a significant concern, collective efforts between organizations and their suppliers are essential to ensuring the integrity and security of the entire supply chain.
