# Password Storage and Attacks

## Storing Passwords: Plain Text vs. Hashing

- **Plain Text Storage:**
	- Attacker's preference as it grants easy access to usernames and passwords.
	- Rare but risky; avoid applications storing passwords in readable formats.
	- Solution: Cease usage of vulnerable applications or find secure upgrades.

- **Hashing Passwords:**
	- Best practice for secure password storage.
	- Hashing converts passwords into unique, irreversible strings known as message digests.
	- Example: SHA-256 algorithm generates unique hashes for different passwords.
	### Example Hashes:
	- Hash for "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6" using SHA-256 is distinct and irreversible.
	- Hashes for various common passwords are unique and of equal length.
	
## Password Attacks: Spraying and Brute Force

- **Spraying Attack:**
	- Bypasses account lockouts by trying a few common passwords.
	- Utilizes top passwords from lists like Wikipedia's most common passwords.
	- Minimizes risk of account lockouts and alarms, focusing on common passwords.
	### Real-life Scenario:
	Attacker attempts a few common passwords for an account and moves on if unsuccessful.

- **Brute Force Attack:**
	- Tries every combination to discover passwords.
	- Time-consuming, especially for longer passwords.
	- Often requires offline attacks with downloaded password files.
	### Real-life Scenario:
	Attacker systematically tests password combinations until a match is found.

## Dictionary Attack and Rainbow Tables

- **Dictionary Attack:**
	- Uses common words from dictionaries as potential passwords.
	- Includes variations, letter substitutions, and specialized dictionaries.
	- Time-consuming but effective against weak passwords.
	### Real-life Scenario:
	Attackers employ dictionaries to guess passwords, including variations.

- **Rainbow Tables:**
	- Precomputed tables for quick password lookup.
	- Challenges: Specific to hashing algorithms; different tables for each application/OS.
	- Obstacle: Salt, random data added to passwords before hashing.

## Importance of Salt in Password Storage

- **Salt in Passwords:**
	- Adds random data to passwords before hashing.
	- Prevents identical passwords from producing the same hash.
	- Increases complexity for attackers using pre-built tables.
	### Real-life Scenario:
	Hashes with different salts for identical passwords result in unique and unpredictable hashes.

## Password Data Breaches and Have I Been Pwned

- **Data Breach: Collection #1 (January 2019):**
	- Massive breach with 1.1 billion unique emails and passwords.
	- Only 21 million unique passwords, emphasizing password reuse risks.
	### Real-life Scenario:
	Users impacted by the breach can check their status on haveibeenpwned.com.

*Note: Secure password storage involves hashing, salts, and awareness of common attack methods. Regularly check for potential compromises on trusted platforms like "Have I Been Pwned."*
