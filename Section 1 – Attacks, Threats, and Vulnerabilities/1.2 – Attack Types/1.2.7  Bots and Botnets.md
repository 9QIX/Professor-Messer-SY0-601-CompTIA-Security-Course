## Botnets: Coordinated Malicious Networks

- **Bot Malware Introduction:**
	- The term **"bot"** is derived from "robot," signifying malware automation.
	- Installed via a Trojan horse, OS/application vulnerabilities, or bundled with normal installations.

- **Botnet Formation:**
	- Collaborates across infected computers, forming a **botnet**.
	- Controlled by a **Command and Control (C&C) server** issuing commands for execution.

		### Real-life Scenario:
		Corporate networks compromised, leading to the formation of botnets for coordinated attacks.

- **Botnet Functions:**
	- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Orchestrates a **massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack.
	- **Proxy and Relay:** Acts as proxies or relays for spam, network traffic, and other tasks.
	- **Rental Services:** Large botnets rented, providing **DDoS as a service** to third parties.

		### Real-life Scenario:
		Malicious actors renting botnets to execute DDoS attacks on targeted websites.

- **Monitoring Botnet Activities:**
	- Utilize [Looking Glass Cyber Map](https://map.lookingglasscyber.com) for real-time global botnet insights.
	- Monitors infections, live attacks, botnet types, and communication locations.

		### Real-life Scenario:
		Security professionals leveraging the Looking Glass Cyber Map to track and analyze global botnet activities.

## Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

- **Security Patching:**
	- Regularly update OS and applications to prevent initial bot installations.
	- Ensure antivirus and anti-malware software has the latest signatures.

		### Real-life Scenario:
		Organizations preventing bot infections through systematic patch management and software updates.

- **Identification and Blocking:**
	- Scan for infections using on-demand anti-malware scans and monitor network traffic.
	- Block known command and control flows using firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), or workstation-level firewalls.

		### Real-life Scenario:
		Network administrators actively blocking botnet communication patterns, preventing malicious activities.
