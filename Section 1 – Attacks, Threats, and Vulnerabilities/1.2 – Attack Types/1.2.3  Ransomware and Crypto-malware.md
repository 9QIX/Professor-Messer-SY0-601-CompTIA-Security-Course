### Overview:
- **Data Value:**
	- Data is often the most valuable asset, including personal documents, family photos, and company information.

- **Ransomware:**
	- Definition: Malware that encrypts data and demands payment (usually in Bitcoin) for decryption.
	- Evolution: From hoaxes to crypto-malware that encrypts actual files for ransom.

- **Crypto-Malware:**
	- Encrypts personal information using cryptography.
	- Victims pay attackers to obtain the decryption key.

- **Example: Ransomware Hoax:**
	- Displays a fake message claiming inappropriate content found, demanding payment.
	- A tactic to scare users into paying fines that are not legitimate.

- **Crypto-Malware Infection: WannaCry:**
	- Locks files, provides instructions on recovery, and specifies the payment process.
	- Highlights the urgency and impact of ransomware attacks.

### Protection Against Ransomware:
1. **Regular Backups:**
	- Maintain offline backups that are not immediately accessible from your computer.
	- Protects against encryption of online or connected backups.

2. **Security Patches:**
	- Keep the operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches.
	- Reduces vulnerabilities that ransomware exploits for infection.

3. **Antivirus and Anti-Malware:**
	- Ensure antivirus and anti-malware software is running with the latest signatures.
	- Detects and prevents ransomware execution.

### Key Points:
- Ransomware encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.
- Crypto-malware uses cryptography to lock files and requires victims to pay for the decryption key.
- Ransomware hoaxes are deceptive messages demanding payment for fake violations.
- WannaCry is an example of crypto-malware with a clear payment demand.
- Protection involves regular offline backups, keeping software updated, and using effective antivirus/anti-malware solutions.
