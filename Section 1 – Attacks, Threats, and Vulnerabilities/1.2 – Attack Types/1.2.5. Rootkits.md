## Rootkits: Operating System Threats

### Definition:
- **Rootkit:**
	- Malicious software that modifies the kernel of an operating system.
	- Primarily found in Unix/Linux systems but can affect Windows, Mac OS, and others.

### Characteristics:
- **Kernel Modification:**
	- Alters foundational operating system components.
	- Operates at a level below regular file modification, making detection challenging.

- **Invisibility:**
	- Becomes part of the operating system, making it invisible to standard antivirus and anti-malware tools.
	- Difficult to identify and remove.

### Combining Rootkits with Malware:
- **Example: Zeus (Zbot) Malware:**
	- Targeted financial theft by transferring money from the victim's bank account.
	- Combined with the Necurs rootkit to enhance persistence and prevent easy removal.

- **Challenges in Removal:**
	- Rootkit integration made it nearly impossible to delete or stop the malware.
	- Standard removal attempts were blocked by the underlying rootkit in the operating system.

### Detection and Removal:
- **Antivirus Software:**
	- Some antivirus tools can identify rootkits.
	- Specific rootkit removers designed for particular variants.

- **UEFI BIOS and Secure Boot:**
	- Modern BIOS (e.g., UEFI) includes Secure Boot functionality.
	- Secure Boot checks for kernel modifications during system boot.
	- Prevents booting if the kernel has been tampered with, mitigating rootkit installation.

### Key Challenges:
- Rootkits operate at a deep level in the operating system.
- Detection and removal are complicated due to integration with the kernel.
- Combining rootkits with malware increases persistence and difficulty in removal.

### Modern Prevention Measures:
- Secure Boot in UEFI BIOS prevents unauthorized kernel modifications.
- Antivirus tools and specific rootkit removers aid in detection and removal.
