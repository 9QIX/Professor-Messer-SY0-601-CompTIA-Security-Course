## **Tokenization:**

- **Definition:**
	- Replacing sensitive data with unrelated tokens.

- **Example:**
	- Social Security number (Original): 26-12-1112
	- Tokenized version: 691-61-8539

- **Application:**
	- Widely used in credit card processing (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay).

- **Benefits:**
	- No mathematical relationship between original data and token, enhancing security.

## **Data Minimization:**

- **Principle:**
	- Collecting only necessary data for a specific function.

- **Examples:**
	- Requesting only essential information during online transactions.
	- Following regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which emphasize minimal necessary data.

## **Data Masking:**

- **Definition:**
	- Obfuscating data to display its existence without revealing details.

- **Techniques:**
	- Shifting data.
	- Shuffling or masking numbers.
	- Displaying only part of the data (controlled by user permissions).

- **Application:**
	- Protecting personally identifiable information (PII), financial details, etc.

## **Anonymization:**

- **Definition:**
	- Making data impossible to identify by removing any association with the original data.

- **Techniques:**
	- Hashing data.
	- Masking with asterisks.
	- Removing identifiable details for analysis while preserving other data.

- **Benefits:**
	- Irreversible process, maintains privacy.



## **Pseudo-anonymization (Pseudonymization):**

- **Definition:**
	- Protecting data while retaining the ability to convert it back if needed.

- **Implementation:**
	- Displaying a different name each time a record is accessed.
	- Consistent replacement (e.g., showing the same name every time).

- **Use Cases:**
	- Balancing data protection with maintaining statistical relationships.


## **Key Considerations:**

- **Consistency vs. Unpredictability:**
	- Choose techniques based on whether you need consistency (pseudonymization) or unpredictability (anonymization).

- **Regulatory Compliance:**
	- Align data protection practices with regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).

- **Security Overhead:**
	- Select methods that offer robust security without excessive computational overhead.

- **User Permissions:**
	- Control data masking based on user permissions to restrict access appropriately.


By incorporating these privacy-enhancing techniques, application developers can contribute to safeguarding sensitive information and meeting regulatory requirements. The choice of method depends on factors like the need for reversibility, consistency, and the nature of the data being handled.
