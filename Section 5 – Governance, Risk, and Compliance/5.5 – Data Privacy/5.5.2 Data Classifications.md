## Understanding Data Sensitivity and Classifications

### Different Levels of Data Sensitivity:

1. **License Tag Number vs. Health Care Information:**
	 - *License Tag Number:* Relatively sensitive, visible to the public.
	 - *Health Care Information:* Highly sensitive, private, and not for public access.

2. **Application Security:**
	 - Different security measures for applications handling diverse data types.
	 - Unique permissions and security controls based on data sensitivity.

### Types of Sensitive Data:

1. **Proprietary Data:**
	 - Private and owned by an organization.
	 - Often includes trade secrets and unique organizational information.

2. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):**
	 - Data tied to an individual (e.g., name, address, telephone number).
	 - Includes biometric information.

3. **Protected Health Information (PHI):**
	 - Highly private health records associated with an individual.
	 - Covers health status, insurance details, and other health-related information.

### Data Classifications:

1. **Public Data (Unclassified):**
	 - Information accessible to anyone.

2. **Private/Classified/Restricted/Internal Use Only:**
	 - Data limited to specific individuals.

3. **Sensitive Information:**
	 - Includes intellectual property, personally identifiable information, and protected health information.

4. **Confidential Information:**
	 - Very sensitive data requiring specific permissions for access.

5. **Critical Information:**
	 - Important data, specific to organizational processes or publicly available.

### Vertical Markets and Data Standards:

- **Financial Organizations:**
	- Handling personal financial details.
	- Compliance with additional laws and regulations.

- **Government Data:**
	- Open data available to the public.
	- Inter-governmental data sharing may occur.
	- Some data protected by laws (e.g., personal financial information).

- **Company-Customer Data:**
	- Collection of customer information.
	- Compliance with laws and regulations specific to the geography.

Understanding data sensitivity is crucial for implementing appropriate security measures and adhering to legal and regulatory requirements. Different types of data require distinct security controls, and organizations must classify data based on its sensitivity to apply suitable protection measures.
