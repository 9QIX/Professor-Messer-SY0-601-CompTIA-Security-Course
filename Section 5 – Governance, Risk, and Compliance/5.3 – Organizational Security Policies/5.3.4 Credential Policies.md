## Credential Management and Security

### Importance of Credential Management

- **Critical for Data Security:**
  - Proper credential management is vital for data security.
  - Inadequate management can make data accessible to unauthorized individuals.

- **Secure Storage of Passwords:**
  - Passwords should be stored on the server side.
  - Client-side applications should not store passwords within the application or operating system.

### Secure Communication and Login Process

- **Encrypted Communication:**
  - Communication during the login process should be encrypted.
  - Use protocols like TLS to ensure secure transmission of credentials.

- **Authentication of Personal Accounts:**
  - Users should log in with their personal accounts.
  - Verify that the user ID matches the individual logging in.

- **Privileged Access:**
  - Users should not have privileged access by default.
  - Privileged access should be granted temporarily when needed.

### Third-Party Accounts and Authentication

- **External System Access:**
  - Users may have third-party accounts for external systems.
  - Implement additional authentication measures like two-factor or multifactor authentication.

- **Audits for Third-Party Accounts:**
  - Conduct periodic audits of third-party accounts.
  - Ensure the safety and uniqueness of third-party accounts.

- **No Account Sharing:**
  - Strictly prohibit sharing of accounts, whether internal or third-party.

### Credential Policies for Mobile Devices

- **Device Certificates:**
  - Deploy device certificates for trusted mobile devices.
  - Certificates validate the device's trustworthiness.

- **Screen Lock Policies:**
  - Enforce screen locks on mobile devices.
  - Define standards for screen lock types and unlocking methods.

- **Additional Authentication Factors:**
  - Introduce additional checks like geolocation verification.
  - Require biometrics and associate devices with users.

### Credential Management for Services

- **Service Credentials:**
  - Background services on devices may require credentials.
  - Different services should use unique credentials based on their access needs.

- **Credential Change Policies:**
  - Implement policies for changing non-interactive service credentials.
  - Ensure changes are propagated to all service accounts.

### Elevated Access and Administrator Accounts

- **Limited Usage of Elevated Accounts:**
  - Elevated accounts (administrator, root) should be used only when necessary.
  - Best practice is to run with a standard user account during normal operations.

- **Security Controls for Elevated Access:**
  - Use multifactor authentication for administrator/root access.
  - Periodically change passwords for enhanced security.

- **Preventing Malware Impact:**
  - Restricting the use of elevated accounts limits the impact of malware on the operating system.
  - Reduces the potential damage caused by user mistakes with elevated privileges.
