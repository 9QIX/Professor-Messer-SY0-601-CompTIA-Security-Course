# Overview of Security Controls in Risk Management

## Introduction

As IT security professionals, managing various risks associated with data, physical property, and computer systems is a primary responsibility. The overarching goals are to prevent security events when possible, limit their impact, and mitigate potential damage. Achieving these objectives involves the strategic implementation of security controls.

## Three Major Categories of Security Controls

1. **Managerial Controls:**
	 - Focus on security design and policy implementation.
	 - Includes security policies and standard operating procedures.

2. **Operational Controls:**
	 - Managed by people.
	 - Examples: Security guards, awareness programs (e.g., phishing awareness).

3. **Technical Controls:**
	 - Implemented using systems and technology.
	 - Examples: Antivirus software, firewalls.

## Common Control Types

### 1. Preventive Control

- **Definition:**
	- Prevents unauthorized access to a specific area.
- **Examples:**
	- Door locks, security guards, firewalls.

### 2. Detective Control

- **Definition:**
	- Identifies and records that a security event has occurred.
- **Examples:**
	- Motion detectors, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

### 3. Corrective Control

- **Definition:**
	- Mitigates damage caused by a security event.
- **Examples:**
	- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), data restoration from backups.

### 4. Deterrent

- **Definition:**
	- May not prevent intrusion but deters potential attackers.
- **Examples:**
	- Warning signs, login banners, visible security measures.

### 5. Compensating Control

- **Definition:**
	- Attempts to recover from an intrusion by compensating for issues.
- **Examples:**
	- Replacing a stolen laptop, backup power systems.

### 6. Physical Control

- **Definition:**
	- Real-world measures to prevent security events.
- **Examples:**
	- Fences, door locks.

## Conclusion

Security controls play a crucial role in managing and mitigating risks. A comprehensive approach involves a combination of managerial, operational, and technical controls, each serving specific preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, compensating, or physical functions.
