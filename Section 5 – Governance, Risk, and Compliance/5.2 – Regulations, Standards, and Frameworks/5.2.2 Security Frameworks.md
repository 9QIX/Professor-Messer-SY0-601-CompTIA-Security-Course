	- Mandatory for U.S. Federal Government Agencies.
	- Encompasses six steps in the system lifecycle, from categorization to continuous monitoring.

- **Steps:**
	- Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor.

- **Application:**
	- Ensures security and privacy adherence for federal government systems.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

- **Designed for:**
	- Commercial implementations with a distinct security posture.

- **Framework Components:**
	- Core: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
	- Implementation Tiers: Tailored approaches to cybersecurity.
	- Profile: Aligns policies, guidelines, and standards with the core.

- **Applicability:**
	- Ideal for commercial environments seeking a high-level view of cybersecurity.

### ISO/IEC Frameworks

1. **ISO/IEC 27001 (ISMS):**
	 - Standard for Information Security Management Systems.
	
2. **ISO/IEC 27002:**
	 - Code of practice for information security controls.
	
3. **ISO/IEC 27701 (PIMS):**
	 - Focuses on Privacy Information Management Systems.
	
4. **ISO 31000:**
	 - International standards for risk management practices.

- **International Standards:**
	- Comprehensive frameworks with broad scope for standardization on an international level.

### SSAE SOC 2 Type I and II

	- Auditing standard from the AICPA (SSAE 18).
	- Focus on trust service criteria, including security controls.
	
- **Audit Types:**
	- Type I: Examines controls at a specific date.
	- Type II: Tests controls over a minimum six-month period.

- **Scope:**
	- Often conducted in large organizations, covering diverse security controls.

### Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)

- **Framework Source:**
	- Developed by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).

- **Matrix Components:**
	- Maps controls to standards, best practices, and regulations.
	- Encompasses security methodologies, assessment tools, and capabilities determination.

- **Applicability:**
	- Addresses security concerns in cloud computing infrastructure.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right security framework depends on organizational needs, industry regulations, and the nature of data handling. IT professionals should leverage these frameworks to strengthen cybersecurity practices, ensuring a resilient defense against evolving threats.
