# Biometric Authentication in Security

## Introduction

Biometric authentication factors rely on unique physiological or behavioral characteristics for user identification. Common biometric factors include fingerprints, retinal scans, iris recognition, voice patterns, facial recognition, gait analysis, and vascular scans.

## Types of Biometric Factors

- **Fingerprint:**
    - Scanners on phones, laptops, and access doors.
  
- **Retina:**
    - Capillaries in the back of the eye.
  
- **Iris:**
    - Frontal eye patterns, textures, and colors.
  
- **Voice:**
    - Voice recognition for access.
  
- **Facial Recognition:**
    - Cameras analyze facial features for access control.
  
- **Gait Analysis:**
    - Examines unique walking characteristics.
  
- **Vascular Scans:**
    - Analyzes blood vessels, particularly in extremities.

## Sensitivity and Metrics

- **False Acceptance Rate (FAR):**
    - Frequency of approving unauthorized users.
    - Adjust sensitivity to reduce FAR.

- **False Rejection Rate (FRR):**
    - Authorized users rejected by the system.
    - Adjust sensitivity to minimize FRR.

- **Crossover Error Rate (CER):**
    - Optimal sensitivity setting.
    - Balances FAR and FRR for efficient biometric performance.

## Sensitivity Adjustment

- **Visual Representation:**
    - Errors increase on the y-axis.
    - Sensitivity levels change on the x-axis.
  
- **Low Sensitivity:**
    - Higher false acceptance rate.
  
- **High Sensitivity:**
    - Higher false rejection rate.
  
- **Crossover Error Rate (CER):**
    - Optimal sensitivity balancing FAR and FRR.

## Conclusion

Biometric authentication provides a secure means of user identification but requires careful sensitivity adjustment. Striking a balance between false acceptance and rejection rates is crucial for effective and reliable biometric systems.
