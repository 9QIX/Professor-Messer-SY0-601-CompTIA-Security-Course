# Automating Complex Deployments: Infrastructure as Code and SDN

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

In the realm of cloud computing, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) emerges as a powerful practice for deploying complex, multi-serviced applications seamlessly. IaC involves describing application instances and infrastructure devices through code, ensuring consistent and automated deployments.

### Key Aspects of IaC

- **Configurations:**
    - Describes hosts, web servers, and database servers.
    - Includes specific configuration settings for individual servers.

- **Consistency:**
    - Enables identical deployments every time.
    - Fundamental to cloud computing's dynamic application instances.

## Software Defined Networking (SDN)

### SDN Fundamentals

- **Control and Data Plane Separation:**
    - Control plane manages device configuration.
    - Data plane handles actual device operations.

- **Agility:**
    - Allows dynamic changes without affecting operations.
    - Essential for the evolving nature of cloud computing.

- **Single Pane of Glass:**
    - Centralized management console for all SDN devices.
    - Programmatically deployable with adherence to open standards.

### Example: Security Devices with SDN

- **Internet Connection Scenario:**
    - Load balancer distributing traffic to multiple web servers.
    - Internal firewall managing communication between web servers and a database server.

- **SDN Benefits:**
    - Software-based deployment for automatic provisioning.
    - Ensures secure communication flows within the architecture.

## Software Defined Visibility (SDV)

### Monitoring in Dynamic Cloud Environments

- **SDV Overview:**
    - Monitors and understands traffic flows.
    - Deploys security devices such as firewalls, intrusion prevention, and web application firewalls.

- **Adaptability:**
    - Understands VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) encapsulation.
    - Recognizes encrypted data using SSL or TLS.

### Information Insights from SDV

- **Real-Time Views:**
    - Web usage, host name usage, and top applications.
    - Gains insights into network activity based on deployed security devices.

- **Threat Response:**
    - Utilizes APIs to control application devices.
    - Responds to identified threats on the network.

The combination of IaC, SDN, and SDV forms a dynamic trio, enabling organizations to automate deployments, ensure secure networking, and monitor activities in the ever-changing landscape of cloud computing.
