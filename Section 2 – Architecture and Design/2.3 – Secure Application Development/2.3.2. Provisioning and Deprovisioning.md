# Provisioning and Orchestration in Cloud Computing

## Introduction

Provisioning is the process of making an application available, involving the deployment of web servers, database servers, middleware, and security configurations. This video explores the provisioning lifecycle, elasticity, orchestration, and the deprovisioning process in cloud computing.

## Security in Provisioning

- **Security Components:**
    - Security patches for OS and application.
    - Network design and architecture.
    - Separate firewall configurations for internal and external access.
    - Security scans for workstation-based software.

## Elasticity

- **Definition:**
    - The ability to increase or decrease available resources based on workload.
    - Enables adjusting resources to match application demand.

- **Example:**
    - Deploying multiple instances to handle increased transactions per second.
    - Decreasing instances during lower demand.

## Orchestration

- **Definition:**
    - Automation of provisioning and deprovisioning processes.
    - Key to cloud computing efficiency.
    
- **Automated Tasks:**
    - Deploying servers, network configurations, and security components.
    - Location-based provisioning for optimized resource utilization.

## Deprovisioning

- **Definition:**
    - The process of completely removing application instances from the environment.

- **Considerations:**
    - Remove security components, including firewall rules.
    - Decide on the fate of data created during application use.
    - Ensure a thorough cleanup to avoid remnants.

## Conclusion

Effective provisioning, elasticity, orchestration, and deprovisioning are crucial aspects of cloud computing. These processes streamline application management, optimize resource utilization, and maintain security standards.
