# Application Security in Development

## Introduction

Developing secure applications involves balancing time, quality, and vulnerability management. This text discusses various security considerations during the application development process.

## Stored Procedures for Database Calls

- **Objective:**
    - Enhance database security by preventing direct client manipulation.

- **Implementation:**
    - Create stored procedures on the database server.
    - Application sends a CALL message to execute the stored procedure.
    - Ensures clients can't modify parameters of the database call.

## Code Obfuscation

- **Purpose:**
    - Make code difficult for humans to understand.

- **Implementation:**
    - Obfuscate code to hinder readability.
    - Maintains functionality while obscuring logic.
    - Aids in preventing easy identification of security vulnerabilities.

## Code Reuse and Dead Code

- **Challenges:**
    - Reusing code across multiple applications can spread vulnerabilities.
    - Dead code adds potential security risks without adding value.

- **Best Practices:**
    - Avoid code reuse without proper validation.
    - Eliminate dead code to minimize attack surface.

## Input Validation

- **Importance:**
    - Unvalidated input can lead to security vulnerabilities.

- **Methods:**
    - Normalize input to expected formats.
    - Utilize server-side validation for robust security.
    - Consider client-side validation for faster response times.

## Memory Management and Buffer Overflow

- **Concerns:**
    - Improper memory management can lead to buffer overflows.
    - Attackers exploit overflows to gain unauthorized access.

- **Prevention:**
    - Developers must manage memory securely.
    - Prefer writing logic over using third-party libraries to control security.

## Encryption of Sensitive Data

- **Requirements:**
    - Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest, in transit, and during display.

- **Implementation:**
    - Use encryption algorithms to secure data.
    - Ensure secure transmission protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
    - Filter or secure display of sensitive information.

## Version Control for Security

- **Advantages:**
    - Version control aids in tracking code changes over time.
    - Useful for comparing and identifying alterations for security analysis.

- **Security Considerations:**
    - Ensure version control history is protected from unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

Securing application development involves implementing practices like stored procedures, code obfuscation, careful code reuse, robust input validation, memory management, encryption, and version control. A holistic approach is necessary to address vulnerabilities and ensure robust application security.
