# Embedded Systems

## Introduction

- **Definition:**
	- Embedded systems are specialized computers and software built for a specific purpose.
	- Examples include traffic light controllers, digital watches, medical imaging systems.

- **System on a Chip (SoC):**
	- Often run on SoCs with multiple components on a single platform.
	- Customizable software for various functions.
	- Examples like Raspberry Pi offer flexibility and off-the-shelf availability.

- **Security Considerations:**
	- Challenges with upgrading hardware on SoC devices.
	- Limited modularity for component replacement.
	- Security professionals face difficulties integrating additional security components.

## Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)

- **Overview:**
	- FPGA is a programmable integrated circuit.
	- Allows post-shipment programming for added functionality.
	- Common in switches, routers, firewalls, and security components.

## Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems

- **SCADA Systems:**
	- Used in industrial settings to control and monitor equipment.
	- Often referred to as Industrial Control System (ICS).
	- Segmented from the internet due to security concerns.

## Internet of Things (IoT) Devices

- **IoT Devices:**
	- Connected devices for various purposes.
	- Examples include smart home devices, wearables, and facility management.
	- Security considerations due to internet connectivity.

- **Security Measures:**
	- Segregating IoT devices on a separate network.
	- Addressing potential security vulnerabilities.

## Specialized Embedded Systems

- **Medical Devices:**
	- Specialized devices like heart monitors or insulin pumps.
	- Challenges with upgrading operating systems.

- **Automobiles and Aircraft:**
	- Embedded systems manage various functions in vehicles.
	- Specialized networks in aircraft demand secure access.

- **Utilities and HVAC Systems:**
	- Embedded systems monitor utilities and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC).
	- Security is crucial for safety and preventing unauthorized access.

- **Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)**
	- Instead of analog phone lines or the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)

## Drones

- **Usage:**
	- Increasingly used for commercial and non-commercial purposes.
	- Built-in security features and fail-safes for safe operation.

## Multi-function Devices (MFDs)

- **Overview:**
	- Printers, scanners, and fax machines in a single device.
	- Sometimes called Multi-function Devices (MFDs).
	- Firmware complexity with image storage and retrieval considerations.

## Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)

- **RTOS in Embedded Systems:**
	- Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for deterministic scheduling.
	- Used in applications like anti-lock brakes in automobiles.
	- Security considerations for RTOS integration.

## Video Surveillance Systems

- **Embedded Cameras:**
	- Advanced functionality with motion sensing and day/night vision.
	- Security concerns for monitoring sensitive areas.
	- Firmware upgrades for constant monitoring and protection.
