# Embedded System Communication

## Introduction

- **Importance:**
	- With the rise in embedded systems, understanding their communication methods is crucial.
- **5G Technology:**
	- Introduced in 2020 for high-speed wireless communication.
	- Offers speeds up to 10 gigabits per second.
	- Significant impact on IoT capabilities with increased bandwidth.
		**Cellular Networks:**
		- Requires a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card.
		- SIM card contains International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) for network recognition.
		- Manages authentication details and contact information.

- **Narrowband Communication:**
	- Uses a narrow range of frequencies for communication.
	- Common in SCADA equipment and sensors over long distances.
		**Benefits:**
		- Efficient use of frequency bandwidth.
		- Suitable for communication across large geographical areas.

- **Baseband Communication:**
	- Uses a single frequency for communication.
	- Common in wired Ethernet connections.
		**Ethernet Standards:**
		- 100BASE-TX, 1,000BASE-T, and 10GBASE-T.
		- Supports bidirectional communication over a single cable.

- **Zigbee Wireless Communication:**
	- IEEE standard, specifically 802.15.4 Personal Area Network.
	- Alternative to WiFi and Bluetooth for IoT devices.
	- Operates in the ISM band, using frequencies in 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz.
		**Zigbee Features:**
		-  Enables communication over longer distances.
		- Low power consumption.
		- Facilitates mesh networking for IoT devices.
		**Mesh Networking:**
		- Devices create a network where communication can hop through others.
		- Ideal for controlling IoT devices spread across a home.
		**Frequency Usage:**
		- Operates in the ISM band, requiring no special licensing.
