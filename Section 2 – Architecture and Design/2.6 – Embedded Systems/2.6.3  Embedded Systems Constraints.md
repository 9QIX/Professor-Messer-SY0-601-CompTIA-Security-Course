# Challenges of Embedded Systems

## Introduction

- **Constraints in Design:**
	- Embedded systems often run on low-cost, purpose-built devices.
	- Examples include devices like Raspberry Pi.
	- Design constraints include limited features and interfaces.
		**Limitations:**
		- No additional features unnecessary for the specific function.
		- Difficult to upgrade due to OS and hardware limitations.
		**Communication Constraints:**
		- Embedded devices may have specific communication types.
		- Wireless or wired interfaces are based on the device's purpose.

	- **Power Constraints:**
		- Commonly deployed in the field with no direct power source.
		- Powered by batteries or rechargeable through solar power.
		- Battery replacement might require physical servicing.

	- **Cost Considerations:**
		- Low-cost off-the-shelf devices with limitations.
		- Constraints on CPU and computing power to keep costs down.

	- **Geographical Limitations:**
		- Location influences networking options.
		- Connectivity limitations based on the device's geographical location.

	- **Cryptography Limitations:**
		- Limited cryptographic capabilities on low-cost embedded devices.
		- Adding or changing cryptographic functionality may not be feasible.

	- **Upgradability Challenges:**
		- Lack of physical input/output devices like keyboards or mice.
		- Firmware upgrades may require direct visits or physical access.

	- **Security Afterthought:**
		- Security features are often added as an afterthought.
		- Limited or no authentication measures for accessing firmware.

	- **Specific Functionality:**
		- Embedded devices are designed for specific functions.
		- No additional capabilities beyond the original design.

	- **Cost-Effective Design:**
		- Specific design keeps costs low, crucial for mass production.
		- Lower cost components may impact device lifespan.

	- **Limited Access:**
		- No direct access to the operating system or software.
		- Difficulties in auditing, updating, or ensuring security.
