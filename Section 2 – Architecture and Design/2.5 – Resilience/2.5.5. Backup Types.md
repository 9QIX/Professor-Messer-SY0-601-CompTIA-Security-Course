# Backup Strategies and Technologies

## Archive Bit and Backup Types

- **Archive Bit in Windows:**
	- Associated with every file system object.
	- Indicates file modification.
	- Visible in file Properties under Advanced Attributes.

- **Backup Types:**
	- **Full Backup:**
		- Backs up all data on the system.
		- Archive bits cleared after backup.
		- Quick restoration with a single set of backup tapes.
	- **Incremental Backup:**
		- Backs up new and modified files since the last incremental backup.
		- Low backup time, high restoration time.
		- Requires full backup and all incremental backups for restoration.
		- Clears archive bits after backup.
	- **Differential Backup:**
		- Backs up all data modified since the last full backup.
		- Moderate backup time and restoration time.
		- Requires full backup and the last differential backup for restoration.
		- Does not clear archive bits after backup.

## Backup Mediums

- **Backup to Tape:**
	- Sequential storage device.
	- Sizes range from 100GB to multiple terabytes.
	- Easy to store and ship, ideal for offsite storage.

- **Backup to Disk:**
	- Faster medium compared to tape.
	- Prices decreased, making disk backups more economical.
	- Supports deduplication and compression.

- **Image and Copy Backups:**
	- **Image Backup:**
		- Duplicates a system at a specific point in time.
		- Exact replica for system restoration.
	- **Copy Backup:**
		- Exact duplicate of a system.
		- Ideal for offsite storage.

## Network Storage

- **Network Attached Storage (NAS):**
	- File-level access.
	- NAS can require rewriting entire files if changes are made.

- **Storage Area Network (SAN):**
	- Block-level access.
	- Efficient storage, changes only affect specific blocks.
	- Requires sufficient bandwidth for data transfer.

## Cloud-Based Backups

- **Cloud-Based Backup:**
	- Automatic offsite backup to the cloud.
	- Supports many devices but requires adequate bandwidth.

- **Image Backup:**
	- Backs up entire system.
	- Ideal for restoring an exact duplicate of the system.

- **Offline and Online Backups:**
	- **Offline Backup:**
		- Backs up to an offline backup system.
		- Usually fast and over a secure channel.
		- Stored offsite for disaster recovery.
	- **Online Backup:**
		- Constantly accessible and updated.
		- Occurs over the network, often to a cloud-based service.
		- Requires sufficient bandwidth for continuous updates.
