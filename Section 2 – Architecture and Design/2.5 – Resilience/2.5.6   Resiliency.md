# Cloud-Based Environments and Redundancy

## Non-Persistence and Snapshots

- **Non-Persistence:**
	- Cloud environments are dynamic, with constant creation and tearing down of application instances.
	- Changes are considered non-persistent, rarely permanent.

- **Snapshots:**
	- Capture current configurations and changed files of an application instance.
	- Useful for restoring instances later or reverting to different versions.
	- Enables easy recovery from issues, especially after software updates.

## Redundancy and High Availability

- **Redundancy:**
	- Options available for failure scenarios.
	- Immediate availability not always guaranteed.
	- Requires specific actions such as powering on machines.

- **High Availability (HA):**
	- Devices always on and immediately accessible.
	- Multiple components working together to maintain uptime.
	- Comes with additional costs for redundancy implementation.

- **Increasing HA:**
	- The more components for high availability, the higher the implementation costs.
	- Multiple firewalls, routers, switches, power systems, etc., increase redundancy.

## Restoration Order and Diversity

- **Restoration Order:**
	- Application components need to be restored in a specific order.
	- Database restoration often a key initial step for core applications.

- **Backup Considerations:**
	- Restoration depends on the original backup strategy (incremental or differential).
	- Incremental backups require the last full backup and all incremental backups.
	- Differential backups require the last full backup and the last differential backup.

- **Diversity of Technology:**
	- Zero-day vulnerabilities may affect specific operating systems.
	- Implementing different operating systems provides diversity.
	- Diversity in technology, vendors, and security components enhances flexibility.

- **Cryptography Diversity:**
	- Cryptography used today is temporary.
	- Upgraded cryptography required as capabilities evolve.
	- Incorporating cryptographic diversity using different certificate authorities.

- **Security Control Diversity:**
	- Administrative, physical, and technical controls combined for diversity.
	- Defense in depth philosophy for enhanced security.
	- Diversity in security controls provides better protection.
