# Redundancy in System Architecture

## Introduction

Redundancy is a critical aspect of system design, ensuring continuous operation and availability in the face of failures. This series of videos will delve into various aspects of redundancy, including hardware, software, network, and geographic redundancy.

## Types of Failures

- **Hardware Failures:**
    - Motherboard, power supply, or other component failures.
- **Software Failures:**
    - Bugs, crashes, or malfunctions affecting services.
- **Network Failures:**
    - Disruptions or outages in network connectivity.
- **Geographic Disasters:**
    - Hurricanes, floods, or other natural calamities impacting a specific location.

## Local Redundancy

- **Hardware Redundancy:**
    - Duplicate critical hardware components.
    - Ensure continuous operation despite individual hardware failures.
- **Software Redundancy:**
    - Implement processes to maintain service availability during software issues.
    - Address bugs promptly to prevent service disruptions.
- **Network Redundancy:**
    - Use Multipath I/O for redundant network links.
    - Enable automatic failover to alternative paths in case of network issues.

## Geographic Redundancy

- **Purpose:**
    - Mitigate the impact of disasters on system availability.
    - Ensure uninterrupted services from a geographically separate location.
- **Implementation:**
    - Establish redundant data centers in different geographical areas.
    - Enable failover mechanisms to redirect traffic to the unaffected location.

## Redundancy Strategies

- **Normal Operations:**
    - Use redundant data centers on different coasts for everyday redundancy.
- **Disaster Recovery:**
    - Have data centers in locations with distinct disaster profiles.
    - Shift operations seamlessly to a redundant center during disasters.

## Network Redundancy Techniques

- **Multipath I/O:**
    - Configure multiple links for disk redundancy.
    - Redirect traffic through alternative paths during network failures.

## Redundancy in Storage - RAID

- **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):**
    - **RAID 0 (Striping without Parity):**
	    - High performance but no redundancy.
    - **RAID 1 (Mirroring):**
	    - Duplicate data across separate drives for redundancy.
    - **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity):**
	    - Distribute data and parity information across drives.
	    - Enables data recovery if a drive fails.
    - **RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)**:
	    - Similar to RAID 5, but with double parity.
    - **Combination RAID:**
	    - Customize redundancy by combining RAID types.
		    - **RAID 10 (Striping + Mirroring):**
			    - RAID 10 combines the features of RAID 0 and RAID 1
		    - **RAID 50 (Striping + RAID 5):**
			    - RAID 50 combines the performance benefits of RAID 0 with the fault tolerance of RAID 5.
		    - **RAID 60 (Striping + RAID 6):**
			    - Similar to RAID 50 but with RAID 6 for double parity. RAID 60 provides enhanced fault tolerance compared to RAID 50.

## Conclusion

Redundancy is a crucial element in system design, encompassing local redundancy to tackle hardware, software, and network failures, and geographic redundancy to address disasters. Techniques like Multipath I/O and RAID provide various levels of redundancy to ensure continuous operation and minimize the impact of failures on system availability. In the upcoming videos, we will delve deeper into specific aspects of redundancy, providing a comprehensive understanding of its implementation in different scenarios.
