# Redundancy in Application Deployment

## Introduction

In the deployment of application instances, it is common to separate the computing engine managing the front end from the centralized data storage. Storing data in a centralized facility, known as a Storage Area Network (SAN), provides redundancy. Multiple front ends can access the same data store, ensuring continuity in case one front end becomes unavailable.

## Storage Area Network (SAN)

- **Definition:**
    - High-performance storage with built-in redundancy.
    - Accessible over high-speed networks.

- **Benefits:**
    - Allows multiple front ends to access the same data store.
    - Supports data replication between SANs for redundancy.
    - Real-time replication or SAN snapshots for data consistency.

- **Data Center Replication:**
    - Replicate data between SANs in different data centers.
    - Ensures availability even if one data center is unavailable.

## Virtual Machine (VM) Replication

- **Cloud-Based Application Instances:**
    - Rely on virtual machines for deployment.
    - Multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously.

- **VM Replication:**
    - Update one VM and replicate changes to others.
    - Acts as a backup in case of primary VM failure.
    - Efficient replication by copying only changed files.

## Replication Strategies

- **Local Replication:**
    - Advantages:
        - Faster network connectivity.
        - Full control over local resources.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Higher upfront costs.

- **Cloud Replication:**
    - Advantages:
        - Low-cost entry point.
        - Scalable costs based on usage.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Slower network connections.
        - Security considerations (encryption and access control).

## Conclusion

Choosing between local and cloud replication involves considerations such as network speed, cost, and security. Both approaches provide redundancy and ensure the availability of data, with each having its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
