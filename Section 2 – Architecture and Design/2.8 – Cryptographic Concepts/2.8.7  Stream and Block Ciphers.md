# Encryption Techniques: Stream Ciphers and Block Ciphers

## Stream Ciphers

- **Definition:**
	- Encrypts one byte at a time.
	- Fast encryption of individual bytes.
	- Commonly used in symmetric encryption.

- **Randomization Challenges:**
	- Lack of awareness about subsequent bytes.
	- Initialization Vector (IV) adds randomization.

## Block Ciphers

- **Definition:**
	- Encrypts fixed-length blocks of data.
	- Block sizes commonly 64 or 128 bits.
	- Often uses symmetric encryption for speed.

- **Modes of Operation Overview:**
	- **Electronic Codebook (ECB):**
		- Same key for every block.
		- Identical input results in identical output.
		- Limited use due to lack of randomization.

	- **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):**
		- XORs each block with the previous ciphertext.
		- Initialization Vector (IV) for added randomization.
		- Overcomes ECB's lack of randomization.

	- **Counter Mode (CTR):**
		- Uses an incremental counter for randomization.
		- Efficient encryption with authentication.
		- Commonly seen in Galois Counter Mode (GCM).

## Galois Counter Mode (GCM)

- **Combination of CTR and Galois Authentication:**
	- Efficient encryption.
	- Provides authentication.
	- Used in wireless connectivity, IPsec, SSH, and TLS.

In summary, stream ciphers excel in fast encryption of individual bytes, while block ciphers, with various modes of operation, offer versatile encryption of fixed-length data blocks. Understanding these techniques is crucial for implementing secure and efficient cryptographic solutions.
