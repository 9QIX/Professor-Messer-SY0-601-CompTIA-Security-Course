# Cryptography Use Cases

## Mobile Device Security

- **Challenge:**
	- Limited storage, CPU, and battery life on mobile devices.
	- Need for efficient encryption.

- **Solution:**
	- Symmetric key encryption with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
	- Ensures data security on devices with resource constraints.

## Fast and Efficient Encryption

- **Requirement:**
	- Fast and efficient encryption.
	- Small key sizes for various projects.

- **Solution:**
	- Symmetric encryption with low latency.
	- Smaller key sizes for improved efficiency.

## Data Integrity Assurance

- **Objective:**
	- Prevent unauthorized data modification.
	- Ensure data validity.

- **Techniques:**
	- Hashing for data integrity.
	- Larger key sizes for robust encryption.

## Securing Information

- **Purpose:**
	- Keep information secret and private.
	- Encrypt files, drives, or entire devices.

- **Methods:**
	- Cryptography for information encryption.
	- Hashing to maintain password integrity.

## Obfuscation in Malware

- **Usage:**
	- Malware encrypts itself within software.
	- Evades signature-based detection in antivirus products.

- **Execution:**
	- Decryption during application execution.
	- Allows malware to run on the local machine undetected.

## Authentication and Password Protection

- **Authentication:**
	- Logging into devices or networks.
	- Protection of passwords using hashing.

- **Additional Security:**
	- Salting passwords for randomization.
	- Hashing combined with asymmetric encryption for non-repudiation.

## Digital Signatures for Non-Repudiation

- **Implementation:**
	- Non-repudiation through digital signatures.
	- Verification of data origin and integrity.

- **Usage:**
	- Confirmation of data source authenticity.
	- Prevention of data alteration post-transmission.
