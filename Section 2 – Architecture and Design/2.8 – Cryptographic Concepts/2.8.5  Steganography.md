# Obfuscation and Steganography

## Obfuscation Overview

Obfuscation is the process of making information intentionally difficult to understand, typically applied to source code or other forms of data. It aims to complicate comprehension without rendering the information entirely inaccessible.

### Source Code Obfuscation

- Used in programming languages to hinder human readability while ensuring functionality.
- Makes it challenging for individuals to understand the logic of a program by looking at the code.

## Steganography

Steganography is a form of obfuscation that involves hiding information within a seemingly innocuous container, such as an image, audio file, or video file.

"Concealed writing" in Greek.

### Basics of Steganography

- **Concealed Writing:**
	- The term "steganography" has Greek roots, meaning concealed writing.
	- Conceals information within a cover text, such as an image.

- **Security Through Obscurity:**
	- Steganography doesn't provide true security; it relies on the secrecy of the method.
	- While invisible to the human eye, information hidden in the container can be retrieved with knowledge of the process.

### Image-based Steganography

- **Cover Text:**
	- The image used as the carrier of hidden information.
	- Extraction of information requires knowledge of the process.

- **Tools and Methods:**
	- Various steganography tools available as open source.
	- Users can store and extract information from images using these tools.

### Network-based Steganography

- **Packet Modification:**
	- Additional bits of information added to network packets.
	- Bits collected on the other end to reconstruct hidden information.

### Other Forms of Steganography

- **Audio Files:**
	- Information hidden within audio files.
	- Documents and data can be concealed and extracted.

- **Video Files:**
	- Larger files allow for more information storage.
	- Video steganography enables the transfer of substantial data within the video file.

### Additional Considerations

- **Watermarks in Laser Printer Output:**
	- Dots in printer output contain information about the printer.
	- Reverse engineering the image reveals details about the printout and its source.

In summary, obfuscation techniques, including steganography, are employed to complicate understanding intentionally. While these methods may not provide absolute security, they add layers of complexity, making it more challenging for individuals to interpret hidden information. Steganography, in particular, extends beyond images to audio and video files, offering diverse means of concealing and transmitting data.
