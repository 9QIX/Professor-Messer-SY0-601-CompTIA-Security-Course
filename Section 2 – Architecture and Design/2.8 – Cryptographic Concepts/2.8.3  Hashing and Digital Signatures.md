# Hashing and Digital Signatures

Hashing is a process designed to create a unique and fixed-size string of text, known as a message digest or fingerprint, for any type of input, such as documents, audio, video files, or large and small files. This one-way trip ensures that the original data cannot be recreated from the hash. Hashing is commonly used for storing passwords securely, providing integrity verification for files, and creating digital signatures.
## Hashing Basics

- **One-Way Process:**
    - Hashing is irreversible, making it suitable for password storage.
    - The output, or hash, is unique to a specific input.

## Password Storage

- **Security Measures:**
    - Hashing passwords prevents storing plaintext passwords.
    - Hashes provide secure authentication without revealing the original password.

- **Salt for Randomization:**
    - Adding random values (salt) to hashes prevents identical hashes for common passwords.
    - Salted hashes enhance security against rainbow table attacks.

## File Integrity Verification

- **Ensuring Integrity:**
    - Hashes can be used to verify the integrity of files.
    - Identical hashes indicate identical files, ensuring data integrity during transfers.

## Hashing Algorithms

- **Collision Issues:**
    - Collisions, where different inputs produce the same hash, are undesirable.
    - MD5 had collision problems, leading to its decreased use in security.

- **SHA256 Example:**
    - SHA256, a 256-bit hashing algorithm, produces a 64-character hexadecimal hash.
    - Even small changes in input result in drastically different hashes.

## Digital Signatures

- **Source Verification:**
    - Digital signatures provide source authentication and non-repudiation.
    - Signatures confirm the sender's identity and that the message hasn't been altered.

- **Signature Creation:**
    - A hash of the plain text message is encrypted with the sender's private key.
    - The resulting digital signature is attached to the original message.

- **Signature Verification:**
    - The recipient uses the sender's public key to decrypt the digital signature.
    - The decrypted hash is compared with a newly generated hash from the received message.

- **Verification Process:**
    - If the hashes match, the message is verified and considered legitimate.
    - Digital signatures ensure data integrity and source authenticity in communication.

In conclusion, hashing plays a crucial role in security by securing passwords, verifying file integrity, and providing authentication through digital signatures. Understanding the principles of hashing is essential for implementing robust security measures in various applications.
