# Cryptography Limitations and Considerations

## Implementation Variability

- **Challenge:**
	- Cryptography implementation varies between applications.
	- Customization based on application requirements.

- **Weakness:**
	- Implementation weaknesses are common.
	- Understanding the original implementation is crucial.

## Speed and Performance

- **Considerations:**
	- Speed of cryptography implementation.
	- CPU capacity for encryption/decryption overhead.
	- Power consumption during encryption processes.

- **Impact:**
	- Increased load on CPU.
	- Higher power and battery usage.

## Block Cipher Size Impact

- **Concern:**
	- Block cipher encryption size impact.
	- Filling blocks for smaller data sizes.

- **Effect:**
	- Encryption block size determines storage needs.
	- Smaller data may require padding, affecting storage.

## Key Size and Strength

- **Importance:**
	- Larger keys enhance brute-force resistance.
	- Weak keys pose security risks.

- **Example:**
	- WEP's weak initialization vector in wireless encryption.

## Time Considerations

- **Duration:**
	- Time required for encryption/decryption.
	- Larger files and asymmetric encryption may take longer.

- **Evolution:**
	- Cryptographic advancements may reduce encryption lifespan.

## Randomization Necessity

- **Essential:**
	- Cryptography relies on randomization.
	- Predictable outcomes without randomization weaken security.

- **Example:**
	- Cloudflare's use of lava lamps for random number generation.

## Key Rotation Overhead

- **Common Practice:**
	- Encryption process remains consistent.
	- Key rotation adds overhead but enhances security.

- **Challenge:**
	- Key compromise risks if unchanged.
	- Balancing security and operational efficiency.

## IoT Device Constraints

- **Limitations:**
	- Limited CPU, memory, and power in IoT devices.
	- Firmware-embedded keys limit key changes.

- **Security Concerns:**
	- Security compromises due to resource constraints.
	- Balancing security needs with device functionality.

- **Maintenance Challenges:**
	- IoT devices may lack built-in security.
	- Ongoing security updates and considerations.
