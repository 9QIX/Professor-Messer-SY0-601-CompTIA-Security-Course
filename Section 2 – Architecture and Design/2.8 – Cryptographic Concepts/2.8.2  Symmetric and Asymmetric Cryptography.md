# Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption

## Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption involves using a single key for both encryption and decryption. It is also known as a secret-key algorithm or shared secret encryption. The main challenge with symmetric encryption is the scalability issue when sharing keys across a network.

### Key Points
- Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- Challenges with scalability in key sharing.

## Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption uses two mathematically related keys: a public key and a private key. This approach overcomes the scalability issue of symmetric encryption but requires more CPU overhead.

### Key Points
- Involves a pair of keys: public key and private key.
- Public key is shared, private key is kept secret.
- Overheads in CPU processing.

## Key Pair Generation

When generating an asymmetric key pair, a key generation program takes a large random number as input and outputs a public key and a private key. The public key is shared, while the private key is kept secret.

## Encrypting and Decrypting with Asymmetric Cryptography

1. **Encrypting Data:**
   - Sender (Bob) uses recipient's (Alice) public key to encrypt the message.
   - The ciphertext is generated.

2. **Decrypting Data:**
   - Recipient (Alice) uses her private key to decrypt the received ciphertext.
   - Original plaintext is revealed.

### Digital Signatures
- The process can be reversed for creating a digital signature.
- Sender (Alice) uses her private key to encrypt the message.
- Recipients (Bob) can verify the signature using Alice's public key.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Scalability Issue
- Transmitting symmetric keys across a network is challenging.
- Asymmetric encryption can be used to exchange symmetric keys securely.

### Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- Overcomes computing power challenges.
- Uses curves instead of large prime numbers.
- Smaller keys with the same level of security.
- Ideal for resource-constrained devices.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption helps in implementing effective security measures based on the specific requirements and constraints of the environment.
