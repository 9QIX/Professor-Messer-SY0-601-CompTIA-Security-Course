# Understanding Blockchain Technology

## Definition

- A **blockchain** is a distributed ledger used to record events across a network.
- Enables decentralized and transparent tracking of transactions and events.
- Common applications include cryptocurrency transactions, digital identification, supply chain tracking, and secure voting.

## Fundamental Process

1. **Adding a Transaction:**
	- Participants initiate transactions (e.g., cryptocurrency payments, voting, inventory updates).
	- Transaction details are sent to all participating devices.

2. **Verification and Confirmation:**
	- Devices maintain ledgers and verify transaction details.
	- Once verified, transactions are added to a block along with other verified transactions.

3. **Block Integrity and Hashing:**
	- A hashing function is applied to all transactions within a block.
	- The resulting hash is added to the block for integrity verification.
	- Any change to the block content will alter the hash, indicating potential tampering.

4. **Adding to the Blockchain:**
	- Verified blocks are added to the existing blockchain.
	- The updated blockchain is distributed to all devices in the network.

## Ensuring Security

- **Hash Verification:**
	- Hashes provide a tamper-proof seal for each block.
	- Changes to any block content will be immediately evident.

- **Distributed Nature:**
	- Ledger copies exist on multiple devices, preventing a single point of failure or manipulation.

## Blockchain Variability

- **Unique Features:**
	- Different blockchain technologies may have distinct features.
	- Varied capabilities based on the specific type of blockchain.

This broad overview highlights the universal process of blockchain technology, emphasizing transparency, security, and decentralization.
